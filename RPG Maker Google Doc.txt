CUCCAA notes:

Guy steals shopping carts and distributes them to the homeless
Walmart needs to have a connected warehouse, like all walmarts already do
Can get better cars and vehicles at the expense of more costly insurance and fines
Car dealership
When a car gets too many miles on it, it breaks down randomly
You can steal food from people’s gardens and sell it to walmart, for them to resell
The guy at the bottom of the ditch who steals the shopping carts has an army of raccoons that attacks you if you get to close
Superfast sprint shoes
The raccoons can give you rabies
Raccoon boss called “The Trashmaster”
You can fish up a super rare spawn of a shopping cart and sell it to the cart guy for a rare item or a lot of money
Cp farm
There is a boss at cp farm called giant cock, which uses corys sprite he made a while back of a rooster
can feed specific enemies drugs causing them to do weird attacks and other things
maybe giving specific enemies drugs can make them have rare drops in some cases
members of the party at first basically use and don’t care all that much for one another but through having to work together they eventually from some sort of bond
semi truck heist
vlargagus von vlargagus in the fish area
prison riot
Walmart influences the drug war
Walmart CEO owns weapons caches they give to their associated gangs
Walmart has associated gangs that work with them specifically, Walmart uses these gangs distribute expensive weaponry to places for a profit
The government agency has intel on this, the illegal drugs, and the cp farm
Walmart uses the weapons caches to arm its gangs who not only help with the arms trade, the gang members also sell drugs to addicts which also reaps in a huge profit
Walmart has a secret weapons factory which is in another country where the laborers work for super cheap, they fly the weapons across the border to weapons caches that are stored in many places that are around walmart
There are smaller and more item specific walmarts in the world, the main walmart is where most of the essential illegal businesses are conducted

Fuck:

Unconventional method of improving certain stats: i.e skill points as opposed to it all increasing as you gain experience
Skill points hidden around the world in the form of secret areas or side quests. Rewards exploring
Karma statistic
Pickpocket ability: stealing into the overworld.
