1. Have soundspace node within scenes in group "Kin" play proper soundbank by fetching name of individual tile textures (as a string) within "Tileset" node when within range
    **Pseudo**
    if (idv. tile name) starts with string "Concrete":
       Soundspace play (ConcreteWalking/ConcreteRunning) #(Depending on action context)

2. Have soundspace node within scenes in group "Kin" play proper soundbank by checking the type of tileset scene when within range 
    **Pseudo**
    if (idv. tile) is a part of ConcreteTileset.tscn:
       Soundspace play (ConcreteWalking/ConcreteRunning) #(Depending on action context)

# --- The questions
What is the purpose/history of the island/mainland?
Why are we going there, and how do we get there?
Where is this located exactly, and how accurate would the biome/environment be?
When do we get there/what time period is this taking place?
