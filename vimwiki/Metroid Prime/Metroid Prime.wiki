== GENERAL/OVERVIEW ==
* Optional [[../reference#Expositional Lore|lore expositions]], [[../reference#Expositional Hinting|information]] and [[../reference#Easter Egg|easter eggs]] are gathered with the scan visor throughout the entire game. A [[logbook]] keeps track of the important data you've collected and can be read anytime.
* Scan certain panels to [[../reference#Activate to Proceed|unlock doors/elevators and activate objects.]]
* Health and ammo drop from crates and enemies (as needed by the player's current health/ammo) throughout the game.
* Areas/rooms are designed only vaguely realistically, with realistic naming conventions.
* Abilities you've become familiar with are lost early-game, and must be progressively reacquired.
* The in-game map allows players to examine the topography of rooms/areas in a 3D perspective. This can help them detect doors and crevices.
* Powerups [[../reference#Audible Hinting|emit subtle sound]] when nearby.
* Missile launcher useful in combat, allows for breaking certain walls/barriers, and has a [[../reference#Area of Effect|blast radius]] that can kill multiple small enemies.
* Certain walls, barriers, and objects are defined with [[../reference#Expositional Hinting|explicitly named materials]], implying they can be broken with a respective ability.
* Morph ball allows access through crevices previously unable to traverse as well as allowing the player to [[../reference#Streamline Ability|move swiftly]] along flat surfaces.
* Key item rooms typically [[../reference#One-way Valves|lock the player from within]] to escape using the respective item.
* Morph ball bombs allow certain materials to be broken, certain switches to be activated, and further [[../reference#Streamline Ability|morph ball mobility options]].
* Varia suit allows access to high-temperature areas.
* Boost ball allows access to higher levels of half-pipes, and [[../reference#Streamline Ability|speeding through areas]].
* Space Jump Boots allows double jumping, making [[../reference#Streamline Ability|traversing old areas much easier]] and new ones possible.
* Thermal visor allows for nightvision, locating certain enemies' [[../reference#Cloaking|weak points]], and finding [[../reference#Cloaking|power conduits]] to activate with wave beam to unlock doors.
* Higher level enemies [[../reference#Backtrack Filler|fill in previous areas]] once certain checkpoints are reached.
* Spider ball allows for latching on and riding certain magnetic rails, as well as [[../reference#Streamline Ability|easier access]] to some areas.
* X-ray visor allows you to see completely [[../reference#Cloaking|invisible objects]] (such as walls and platforms), which are sometimes [[../reference#Visual Hinting|hinted toward by rain droplets]]
* Grapple beam allows for swinging to areas unable to jump to or otherwise reach, and also [[../reference#Streamline Ability|quicker area traversal]]
* [[../reference#Non-linear Item Quest|2/3rds non-linear item quest]] to proceed into Phazon Mines depths (X-ray visor/grapple beam free post-power bomb, plasma beam free post-grapple beam)
* Plasma beam allows for access through red doors, and melting ice. Although it has a limited range, it makes quick work of enemies with its fast and powerful damage that also [[../reference#Tick Damage|sets enemies on fire]] and disintegrates many regular enemies with one charge shot
* Most upgrades are generally [[../reference#Multi-purpose Abilities|multi-purpose tools]] that serve purposes in some combination of progression, combat and/or streamlining
* New abilities can enable [[../reference#Unlockable Shortcuts|access through shortcuts]] for quicker, more streamlined traversal between areas and macro-areas
* Upon acquiring all key upgrades, the games [[../reference#Grand Fetch Quest|grand fetch quest]] begins, assisted by [[../reference#Expositional Hinting|hints]] on where to find the Chozo artifacts. These hints are scanned at the [[#Artifact Temple|artifact temple]], where a name of the area to find them is highlighted, and a vague description on how to achieve them.
* Level design, enemy design, and hidden powerups all take future upgrades into account for mid and late game exploration with consideration to the [[../reference#Powerup Flow|"powerup flow"]] to some degree.
* [[../reference#Graphical FX|Atmospheric visual flare]] such as visor condensation, rain/water droplets, visual static, enemies' blood, and facial reflections appear throughout the game. Also, shooting very quickly for an extended time, Samus's arm-cannon will [[../reference#Graphical FX|emit heat-waves]].

%% * Certain beam weapons allows for [[../reference#Environmental Transformation|environmental transformation]] giving access to new micro-areas. (hall of the elders)
%% * [[../reference#Macro-Alternation Model|Alternation between macro-areas]] after Flahgraa (Phendrana > Tallon Overworld > Phendrana)
%% * [[../reference#Inverse Forking|Two different roads]] within Magmoor caverns to choose from after Flahgraa to access Phendrana Drifts
%% * Turret defense disabling through use of scanning panels (optional). [[../reference#Visual Hinting|(Visual Hinting)]], [[|(Mechanical Hinting)]], [[|(out of box option)]]
%% * Elevators serve as [[../reference#Fast Travel|access between macro-areas]]

== AREAS ==

=== PIRATE FRIGATE ===
[[file:metroidprime_map_frigate.jpg|>> MAP <<]]
* The pirate frigate serves as a temporary tutorial area to get the player accustomed to the game's controls and mechanics in the very beginning of the game. This area is also reused later in a completely different way from the tutorial section. The game provides [[expositional hints]] by telling them how to activate and use certain mechanics and weapons such as scan visor, morph ball, missiles, charge beam etc., and features a basic boss fight and [[timed escape sequence]] at the end before revoking several of the player's abilities that they had learned to use.

==== Exterior Docking Hangar ====
* The game begins with an open platform with the player facing two columns with [[../reference#Shoot Targets to Proceed|buttons that must be shot]] in order to deactivate the first force field and proceed.
* Using the scan visor to [[../reference#Search and Activate to Proceed|find and activate]] certain [[../reference#Cloaking|hidden targets]] allows the player to aim and shoot [[../reference#Target Practice|higher targets]] to deactivate the next force field to proceed. From here, standard doors can be opened by shooting them.
* The perimeter of the platform is blocked off with what are essentially [[../reference#Invisible Walls|invisible walls]] so that the player can move freely in the tutorial area without falling. These barriers glow when touched or shot to provide more [[../reference#Immersive Feedback|immersive feedback]] than if they were to merely exist without being seen.

==== Air Lock ====
* Upon entering, mist creates [[../reference#Graphical FX|visor condensation]] for added effect, and well as floating parasites in zero-gravity that explode when shot- [[../reference#Graphical FX|spraying blood]] on the player's visor.

==== Emergency Evacuation Area ====
* This area presents low level enemies that are non-threatening to [[../reference#Target Practice|practice shooting]].

==== Deck Alpha Umbilical Hall ====
* A rubble blockage requires a [[../reference#Shoot Targets to Proceed|charge beam shot]] to blow it open and proceed.

==== Map Facility ====
* A cutscene plays showing parasites [[../reference#Visual Hinting|scampering into a hole]] and into the map room, implying that the morph ball can (optionally) be used to acquire a map of the area.

==== Connection Elevator to Deck Beta ====
* Here, elevators are shown how they work. First, [[../reference#Search and Activate to Proceed|find the node]] to scan its respective elevator, and [[../reference#Activate to Proceed|step into the hologram]] to activate the elevator.

==== Deck Beta Conduit Hall ====
* A blockage fills the room with a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|small hole]] to fit a morph ball inside, but an electrical hazard also guards the hole. [[Yield to Proceed|Timing is needed]] to get past it safely.

==== Biotech Research Area 1 ====
* [[../reference#Taste Testing|Crippled enemies]] patrol the room, but also a large ventilation shaft cover [[../reference#Teaser|appears to be unstable]], but doesn't do anything at the moment.
* Upon returning to this area during the escape sequence, a massive explosion allows for jumping atop broken rubble to climb back up to what was a covered ventilation shaft, but is now accessible.

==== Biohazard Containment ====
* Security defense turrets guard the halls of this area and are hostile. The player is instructed to optionally use missiles, but [[../reference#Out-of-box Option|scanning a hidden nearby node]] will deactivate the nearby turret, rendering it harmless. Nearby tanks hold some basic [[../reference#Teaser|enemies and creatures]] of Tallon Overworld to be examined, as well as a cell with a violent, shaking door with some creature inside, merely to distract and interest of the player.

==== Reactor Core Entrance ====
* Following a cargo lift with an encounter with a fully capable enemy, and a cargo door with morph ball needed to activate and open, the reactor core entrance features a [[|save room]] before a fight with [[#Parasite Queen|the boss]]. Following the defeat over the boss begins the escape sequence.

==== Ventilation Shaft ====
* Following the aforementioned ventilation opening allows full access to the vent shaft. Massive [[../reference#Cluster Enemies|clusters of parasites]] scurry in panic, and are mildly harmful such large numbers. [[../reference#Graphical FX|Heat vapor]] can also condensate on the visor. A room with a massive sliding piston requires the player to move along with the piston and enter the side door before the piston strokes again.

==== Biotech Research Area 2 ====
* Meta Ridley makes his appearance in a cutscene, and the player must [[#../referenceTaste Testing|use the grapple beam]] to fly over the pool to proceed.

==== Connection Elevator to Deck Alpha ====
* Upon scanning a panel to deactivate a defense turret, and avoiding another [[../reference#Yield to Proceed|electrical hazard]], a cutscene plays after activating the elevator that removes most of your suit augmentations and abilities. Upon exiting back through the air lock and into the docking hangar completes this area.

=== TALLON OVERWORLD ===
[[file:metroidprime_map_tallon.jpg|>> MAP <<]]
* Tallon Overworld is the first "true" [[macro-area]] of the game after the tutorial sequence, and serves somewhat as a weak-hubworld as it is the area of origin, and offers paths to every other macro-area in the main game, but isn't rigidly structured or much differently from other macro-areas that are less hub-like, nor is it as particularly large as the other macro-areas, nor does it serve any large significance in the game until the middle and later stages of the game.
* Stage 1 of Tallon Overworld is the basic initial exploration phase of the game with several paths to choose from as well as several areas and [[../reference#Micro-areas|micro-areas]] the player [[../reference#Teaser|cannot access]] while exploring. Blast shields reflect beam shots and crevices can only be bypassed with morph ball, both of which are acquired later in Chozo Ruins stage 1.
* After stage 1 of Chozo Ruins has been completed, the player can opt to return to Tallon to explore the other areas that were previously inaccessible. Upon doing so, they should find the elevator door to begin the first stage of [[#MAGMOOR CAVERNS|Magmoor Caverns]].
* Stage 2 of Tallon Overworld is short-lived, as the player returns from their journey all the way from [[#Phendrana Drifts|Phendrana Drifts]] where they've acquired the boost ball ability. The canyon, a common merging place between paths between Magmoor and Ruins, holds the key to obtaining the space jump boots, where the player will trek back to Phendrana thereby ending the second stage.

==== Landing Site ====
* The game now starts off with having landed on Tallon Overworld, and immediately the player is presented with several doors visible. The path to the elevator to the Chozo Ruins being the intended way to progression.
* Directly behind the ship is a [[../reference#Teasers|foothold out of reach]] from the player with a door behind it.
* A suspicious crevice surrounded by tangleweed hides a missile expansion from within, but [[../reference#Teasers|access is restricted]] to those who have acquired morph ball.
* Upon entering from the suspicious room on the bridge in the [[#Tallon Canyon|canyon]], the player is lead back into the landing site from the foothold previously inaccessible, allowing the player to access the space jump boots.

==== Tallon Canyon ====
* Sap sacs are essentially [[bio-organic crates]] that explode upon death and incentivize the player to shoot them due to their [[../reference#Visual Hinting|bright color]].
* A door only [[../reference#Visual Hinting|visible on the map]] seems to be loosely connected with an overhead bridge [[../reference#Visual Hinting|connected to a sap sac]].
* Upon traversing back to Tallon Overworld post-stage 1 Phendrana, the player will determinately return to this room in some fashion coming from either the Caverns or Ruins. This is notable, because this room holds the next key to progression, being the large half-pipe structure in the room allowing access to the overhead bridge.

==== Root Cave ====
* A platform across from the main entrance/exit towards the top is divided by a large gap and a grapple point, being [[../reference#Teaser|the only way]] to cross the gap.
%% After 2/3rds non-linear fetch quest, the xray visor can be used here while striving toward the red door, and can induce a callback when eventually returning to the quarantine cave...

==== Root Tunnel ====
* Upon entering from either end of the tunnel, the player can hear a [[../reference#Audible Hinting|faint powerup sound]] coupled with the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|dust particles from below]] the bridge, hint toward a missile expansion below it.

==== Artifact Temple ====
* Only after having acquired missiles and bypassed the blast shield on the door, the mysterious artifact temple [[../reference#Significant Landmarking|appears and feels highly significant]] given its [[../reference#Expositional Lore|lore]] and atmosphere, and upon obtaining the first of [[../reference#Grand Fetch Quest|twelve artifacts]] sitting in the center of the podium, the player is given their first (and only) [[../reference#Expositional Hinting|explicit game objective]], although it's a long-term objective and cannot be fully completed until the very-late stage of the game.

==== Frigate Crash Site ====
* Occupying this area is a large pool of water mediating the player from a suspicious large structure at the far end of the room. The player can explore the pool and even come up from the other side provided they've acquired the space jump boots, but they are cut short once reaching the large structure to be [[../reference#Teaser|blocked off]] by a notable white door.
* Within the pool is a missile expansion perched atop an [[../reference#Teaser|inaccessable corner]], where the gravity suit is required to grab it.

==== Life Grove ====

=== CHOZO RUINS ===
[[file:metroidprime_map_chozo.jpg|>> MAP <<]]
* Chozo Ruins is the first [[macro-area]] of significant importance in the game, as stage 1 really establishes the metroidvania model efficiently.
* [[../reference#Two-sector Alternation Model|Two-sector alternation model]] featuring a [[../reference#Double Roundabout|roundabout]] and two [[branches]] in Stage 1 Chozo Ruins.
* Due to the [[../reference#Floor is Lava|toxic acid]], many rooms have hazardous floors that should be avoided as much as possible.
* [[../reference#Cluster Enemies|Cluster enemies]] occupy most of the cylindrical transition halls, and they drop loads of health/ammo due to their numbers. They scurry and gather collectively in a set spot to deal damage upon contact, so you are initially incentivized to shoot them, but once the morph ball is aquired, you can quickly [[../reference#Out-of-box Option|roll past them]] without having to deal with this, [[../reference#Streamline Ability|streamlining]] the process.
* Heavy use of [[../reference#Teaser|visible, but unusable]] spider ball tracks in stage 1, to really drive home the idea that spider ball will be useful in this area later.
* Upon defeating the first [[#Flahgraa|boss]], the [[../reference#Environmental Transformation|toxic acid becomes clean water]]- marking the end of stage 1, but is only able to be walked into and explored to a very limited extent at this point.
* During the backtracking phase After grabbing the boost ball Phendrana, the player can take the branch leading back to the Ruins [[#Transport to Magmoor Cavers North|elevator room]] and perform the second roundabout starting from the [[#Vault|vault]] if they hadn't already, but during the trek back to Tallon Overworld the player will run into the half-pipe within the [[#Main Plaza|main plaza]] from before and can grab the missile upgrade that they couldn't before, reminding the player of the technique they had to learn from within the [[#Phendrana Canyon|Phendrana canyon]] which can help the player remember this technique for [[#Tallon Canyon|progression]] nearby. This works in tandem with the half-pipe found in the [[#Ruined Shrine|ruined shrine]] if they decide to re-examine that as well.
* Stage 2 of Chozo Ruins comes after spider ball is acquired, as well as other [[../reference#Streamline Ability|new toys]] found throughout the game to help streamline re-traversal and unlock more secrets. The spider ball teasers in the first stage heavily imply that you can make use of them here. Although we've seen several instances of tracks here, the only one of those that is needed for further progression is in the [[#Furnace|furnace]].

==== Main Plaza ====
* Similar to the [[#Landing Site|landing site]], this area opens the player up to several paths to choose from with only one correct combination for progression, but several ways to explore in and out.
* A door blocked by a blast shield [[../reference#Teaser|cannot be opened]] until the missile launcher has been acquired.
* A missile upgrade sits within a crevice atop a half-pipe, impossible to acquire at this point in time.
* An energy tank perched on a high cliff behind a door grabs the player's attention as it can [[../reference#Teaser|merely be seen]], with no clues yet as of how to acquire it.
* A Chozo tree in the center doesn't immediately look special, but [[../reference#Visual Hinting|reflects missiles]] similar in nature to blast shields.

==== Eyon Tunnel ====
* Eyons- sentinel-like ocular creatures that shoot lasers from walls- fill this room. They are generally non-threatening and easy to avoid. Shooting them will temporarily [[../reference#Incapacitation|close them shut]].
* A small railing with an opening implies that if morph ball was used that you could go under the rail, but this is mostly impractical in this case.

==== Ruined Nursery ====
* Upon entering, a morph ball puzzle with a missile upgrade appears on the wall, but [[../reference#Teaser|cannot be interacted with]] at this time, as the morph ball has not been acquired.
* A save room sits atop this area as well, but war wasps appear in groups when their hive is approached. You can preemptively [[../reference#Termination|destroy the hive]] with a missile, but only once they are acquired from the first [[#Hive Mecha|boss]].
* Once bombs have been acquired, the player can return to the morph ball [[../reference#Sokoban Puzzle|block puzzle]], where must bomb a certain block first to grab the missile upgrade.

==== Ruined Gallery ====
* A [[../reference#Visual Hinting|fractured wall]] sits in plain view on the bottom level from the entrance, but cannot be opened without the missile launcher.
* Also on the bottom level is a small patch of ambient weeds that [[../reference#Visual Hinting|grab your attention]], as to hint towards a [[../reference#Teaser|morph ball tunnel]] that also requires bombs to access.
* A blast shield on the door blocks access from the [[map room]] of this macro-area, but can be opened on the way back from grabbing the missile launcher.

==== Totem Access ====
* Plazmites- firefly-like creatures- roam the dark hallway, and [[../reference/Termination|their light goes out]] upon death, [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|making the room noticeably darker]].

==== Transport Access North ====
* After defeating the [[#Hive Mecha|boss]], a blast shield guarding the door to the room can be opened, revealing an energy tank, but also shows a tunnel in plain sight the size of a morph ball, heavily reminding the player to [[../reference#Teaser|return to explore it]] once the morph ball has been acquired.
* Once the morph ball has been acquired from the [[#Plated Beetle|boss]], the player can immediately return and explore this tunnel, revealing a morph ball section with automated lifts. The exit of the tunnel is raised, and the player [[../reference#One-way Valves|cannot go back]] through the other way unless they acquire bombs, whereby then then the player can blow up [[../reference#Streamlining|blocks in the tunnel to bypass the lifts]].

==== Ruined Shrine ====
* After opening the shielded door from the [[#Main Plaza|main plaza]], the player is met with this room which [[../reference#One-way Valve|closes you off]] into a [[#Plated Beetle|boss fight]], eventually rewarding the player with the morph ball.
* After obtaining the morph ball, the player can use it to escape the room, but they may also notice a [[../reference#Teaser|morph ball tunnel blocked]] with [[../reference#Expositional Hinting|sandstone]] in the arena. Any attempt to unblock it is futile, and the player has no choice but to return later if they want to explore it.
* Near the opening of the room lies a [[../reference#Teaser|somewhat suspicious looking half-pipe]] structure.
* Atop a high cliff on the far end of the room lies the first notable instance of a [[../reference#Teaser|purple door]]. However, even if the player had the means of opening said door, they learn that they would [[../reference#Teaser|need a way to ride]] along magnetic rails, that being the only way of reaching it.

==== Transport to Magmoor Cavers North ====
* This room has three doors and an elevator leading to [[#MAGMOOR CAVERNS|Magmoor Caverns]]. Discovering this elevator should [[../reference#Visual Hinting|remind the player]] of another macro-area to potentially to go next.
* After finishing the first stage of Chozo Ruins, and arriving from the [[#Hive Totem|hive totem]], the player is immediately incentivized to move on to the [[#MAGMOOR CAVERNS|next area]], but can alternatively begin the second roundabout with bombs having been finally acquired, eventually leading back to the elevator to continue.

==== Hive Totem ====
* Many war wasps occupy the room, and a spider ball rail is [[../reference#Teaser|front-and-center]], but nothing can immediately be done here in the first stage.
* Upon defeating the final [[#Flaghraa|boss]] of the first stage of the Ruins, you are [[../reference#One-way Valve|dropped from the top to the bottom]] of the room, and subsequently led back to the [[#Transport to Magmoor Cavers North|elevator room]]. From before

==== Vault ====
* [[../reference#Activate to Proceed|Three locking mechanisms]] keep a missile upgrade locked within the vault. Unless the player has acquired bombs, the player can merely [[../reference#Teaser|observe]], and return on the second roundabout. However, upon exiting this room and the next, they are greeted with the perched energy tank seen in the [[#Main Plaza|main plaza]] before, thereby completing the first roundabout.
* Beginning on the second roundabout after the player has bombs, they can attempt to unlock the mechanisms on the vault, and while the first two are straightforward, the third lock [[../ref#Skill Check|requires mastery]] of bomb-hopping.

==== Meditation Fountain ====
* More plazmites roam the dark room and react identically to how they did [[#Totem Access|before]], but visibility is now severely limited upon [[../reference#Termination|killing them]].
* A fountain spews toxic acid below a long magnetic spider ball track, but the player [[../reference#Teaser|cannot interact]] with it at this point in time.
* After defeating [[#Flahgraa|Flahgraa]] and cleansing the water, the fountain in the center can now function as intended whereas before it was clogged. A plazmite even hints at this as it [[../reference#Visual Hinting|dies when flying over the water jet]]. While the player can jump into the jet with morph ball, [[../reference#Teaser|they cannot do anything]] until they have acquired the spider ball, as it is the other piece needed to ride the magnetic rail and grab the missile upgrade.
* Upon returning with the spider ball in stage 2 and riding the rail, the player is rewarded with a missile expansion.

==== Magma Pool ====
* Similarly to the Magmoor Caverns, the magma pool is so hot that it will slowly burn you to death [[../reference#Teaser|if you try to enter it]] without the Varia suit.
* Upon returning with the Varia suit post-stage 1 Chozo, the room can be entered, but not much can be done besides look across to the other side, but the [[../reference#Teaser|grapple points imply]] that it can be crossed later.

==== Arboretum ====
* Reaper vines guard the platforms as they swing violently when approached, and [[../reference#Shoot to Proceed|must be shot]] to force them to temporarily retract.
* Upon moving up the walkway, the player is met with tunnels in the wall, but blockage within the tunnels [[#../reference#Teaser|requires bombs]] in order to proceed any higher.
* After acquiring bombs from the [[#Incinerator Drone|boss]], the wall tunnels can now be cleared, allowing access up the walkway. The player is also incentivized to [[../reference#Shoot to Proceed|shoot the toxic venom weed]] to avoid taking big damage from within the tunnel. While climbing, the player may notice that they must [[../reference#Search and Activate to Proceed|find and scan]] four runic symbols (as they may have [[#Mechanical Hinting|done before]] in a [[#Watery Hall|previous room]]) to unlock the gate and reveal the final [[#Flahgraa|boss room]] for this stage.
* A patch of more venom weed at the bottom also hide one of these symbols. [[../reference#Shoot to Proceed|Shooting them]] will force them into hiding, allowing it to be activated.

==== Gathering Hall ====
* Climbing/platforming up the treacherous path reveals the door to progression, but the save point door, as well as another path are both fruitful as well.
* Depending on the angle/platform your standing from, dormant shriekbats can be seen and preemptively dispatched before agitated.

==== Watery Hall Access ====
* Behind a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|fractured wall]] along the side of the hallway, [[../reference#Audible Hinting|a powerup can be heard]], signifying that it's there. Only a missile is required to destroy the wall and grab it.

==== Watery Hall ====
* Four runic symbols must be [[../reference#Search and Activate to Proceed|found and scanned]] in this room to unlock the gate at the end.
* Upon entering the gate, a series of dormant eyons guard the access to the charge beam powerup. Once acquired, the eyons activate. Whereas before, you could merely [[../reference#Incapacitation|incapacitate]] the eyons, you can now [[../reference#Termination|destroy them]] with the charge beam.
* A blocked tunnel sits aside the powerup, and bombs are required to access it (as well as missiles for the blast door), leading to the [[#Dynamo|dynamo]].

==== Dynamo ====
* The dynamo contains a metal structure containing a missile upgrade, and yet another inaccessable rail track, further [[../reference#Teaser|conditioning]] the player to come back once they've acquired spider ball.

==== Energy Core Access ====
* Eyons guard this room similarly to the [[#Eyon Tunnel|eyon tunnel]], but an alternate path below the ground allows you to bypass them, but since it's blocked by rubble, the player can only use it [[../resources#Teaser|once they've acquired bombs]].

==== Energy Core ====
* Two paths split the room upon entry, with acid blocking one, but a morph ball tunnel marking progression in the other. The space in the center is flooded with acid.
* The patient stone toad blocks access to another switch and swallows morph balls when approached, but can only be [[../reference#Teaser|destroyed from within]] with bombs from the upcoming [[#Incinerator Drone|boss]].
* Upon acquiring the bombs, the stone toad can be destroyed and bypassed, allowing access to the switch to initiate the [[../reference#Timed Consecutive Action Sequence|timed morph ball bomb slot sequence]]. The first switch drains the acid in the center, clearing the room and the path from before, the second switch raises two elevators in the center to access the room with the final switch which raises the final elevators, enabling access to the [[#Furnace|furnace]]. The acid remains drained and the elevators aloft permanently once the switch sequence is completed.

==== Burn Dome ====
* Immediately after defeating the [[#Incinerator Drone|boss]] and acquiring bombs,

==== Furnace ====
* Upon entering the furnace, another [[../reference#Teaser|unusable magnetic rail system]] makes an appearance, but a basic tunnel next to it allows access to an energy tank.

==== Tower of Light ====
* Tower of light is a very tall, cylindrical room featuring sets of platforms reaching to the top. On four sections along the circumference of the cylindrical room there are [[stress points]] indicating that they can be damaged. The stress points can be destroyed with 3 missiles each for a total of 12 missiles minimum for each round. Upon dispatching the stress points, the room [[../reference#Environmental Transformation|truncates itself from the middle]], thereby lowering the upper part of the room, where the player repeats the process twice more, with increased challenge coming from moving [[missile reflecting enemies]] along the stress points and [[sun rays obscuring your vision]].
* [[../reference#Quantitative Gatekeeping|At least 36 missiles]] are required to complete the room in one go.
* [[../reference#Replenishment Mob|Replenishment mobs]] are used to assist with keeping enough missiles.

==== Hall of the Elders ====
* A miniboss fight always begins upon entering this room, but it's

%% During backtracking for items, find optional elevator to magmoor caverns north blocked by intense heat (one in Ruins, another in Overworld).

=== MAGMOOR CAVERNS ===
[[file:metroidprime_map_magmoor.jpg|>> MAP <<]]
* Magmoor caverns gets effectively unlocked once the Varia suit has been acquired, as it is a high-heat zone. Thus, there is lots of [[../reference#Floor is Lava|dangerous lava]] all around. By this point, the player should have enough platforming experience avoiding acid in Chozo Ruins to be able to respect the lava.
* Magmoor caverns functions more like a transitional macro-area to bridge the gap between other macro-areas, almost like a weak hub-world but more snakey and trial-like in nature. Barely any extended focus is given to here as opposed to other areas.
* Stage 1 of Magmoor Caverns is essentially an inverse fork where you can enter from two very seperate areas (from either the [[#Transport to Magmoor Cavers North|Ruins]] or [[#Root Cave|Overworld]]), but they eventually meet and converge with each other into the path needed for progression by the end of this stage. Additionally, both branches of the fork have one achievable powerup within them, giving explorational integrity to either path both coming in during this stage, and coming out after Phendrana stage 1.
* Post stage 1 Phendrana, the player will return to the [[#Monitor Station|monitor station]] where- if they hadn't before- could notice the alternate entrance there originating from the other branch in the aforementioned fork and take that route instead. Since there isn't that much to do or see in Magmoor besides end up walking straight in either direction towards either the [[#Transport to Tallon Overworld West|Tallon]] or [[#Transport to Magmoor Cavers North|Chozo]] elevators as everywhere else is blocked off with spider ball tracks, which deincentivizes the player to stay and explore this area, as it is not necessarily intended during this sub-stage.

==== Burning Trail ====
* After descending upon automated lifts and encountering a save room, the player is offered a [[../reference#Teaser|sneak peek]] into Magmoor Caverns, but they cannot safely explore until after acquiring the Varia suit after Chozo Ruins stage 1.

==== Lake Tunnel ====
* Slowly descending platforms guarded by alternating flamethrower traps surrounded by lava force the player to [[../reference#Yield to Proceed|yield to traps and lava]] before encountering burrowers, which pop in and out from underground and [[../reference#Peakaboo Weakspot|must be shot in midair]] as the attack. The real meat of the caverns soon begins.

==== Lava Lake ====

==== Pit Tunnel ====
* The open area is blocked by a tall gate, but the way through is an underground hole on either side. The pit is crawling with triclops, a creature that will punish you by spitting you back out the hole you came in if it grabs you. Bomb placement is key to properly dispatch of them and make it to the other side.
* After acquiring the space jump boots, the player can avoid the pit altogether and simply [[#Streamlining|jump over the tall gate]].

==== Triclops Pit ====
* With just one entrance and one exit, a massive underground pit of triclops hold the secret to a missile powerup.
%% Invisible platforms...

==== Monitor Station ====
* The inverse fork characteristic of stage 1 forms a convergence at this room, where both branches of the fork meet. The [[../reference#Landmarking|massive structure]] in the room guarded by defense turrets indicates importance, and incentivizes the player to climb and explore it- first and foremost.
* While walking across the bridge leading to the next room, a scaffold that's [[../reference#Teaser|barely out of reach]] can be seen to the side, with another bridge directly above the current one. The significance of this is ambiguous at this point.
* After having acquired the space jump boots, the player can return and successfully mount the high scaffold from before and activate a suspension bridge with the boost ball at the top of the room to access the high foothold and the door leading to the [[#Warrior Shrine|warrior shrine]].

==== Transport to Tallon Overworld West ====
* Upon entering from Tallon Overworld through the [[#Root Tunnel|root tunnel]], the player is met with two opposite rooms. Unless the player has completed Chozo Ruins stage 1 and obtained the Varia suit, neither room will be explorable as they will slowly burn you to death.The two doors bring the player toward [[#Transport Tunnel B|transport tunnel B]], and the [[#Twin Fires Tunnel|twin fires tunnel]].

==== Transport Tunnel B ====
* A long river of lava with no platforms fills nearly the whole room end-to-end, but a small opening in the ground with a magnetic rail looks like it leads to the other side, but without spider ball, the player [[../reference#Teaser|cannot interact]] with it and reach the other side.
* Upon coming back through the other end after Phendrana Drifts stage 2, the player can use spider ball to ride the ceiling rail and get to the other side.

==== Twin Fires Tunnel ====
* an opening in the wall on either side provides access to a double-rail track similar to a railroad for the morph ball to ride through, but a disturbed magmoor makes an appearance at the end. The player can either rush through as fast as they can to bypass him or fight him, and proceed.

==== Fiery Shores ====
* Flamethrowers mounted to the ceiling activate at set intervals, so the player must [[../reference#Yield to Proceed|respect them]] to avoid being pushed by them into the lava.
* A distant platform is too far away to jump to without falling into the lava, but a [[../reference#Skill Check|morph ball scaffold without guard rails]] goes across the ceiling of the room and rewards the player not only with a powerup, but leads them to the distant platform, but one small mistake on the scaffold can send the player plummeting into the lava.
* A triclops roams the platform in search of morph balls to toss into the lava. The player can either avoid him all together or kill him with a bomb. A morph ball tunnel can be used to take the player back to the entrance.
* Upon entering from the [[#Shore Tunnel|shore tunnel]] (or post-stage 1 Phendrana), the player can simply take the tunnel that leads to the other side without needing to take the ceiling scaffold.

==== Shore Tunnel ====
* The center of a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|damaged tunnel]] made of [[../reference#Expositional Hinting|bendezium]] has an [[../reference#Audible Hinting|audible missile upgrade]] beneath it.

==== Transport Tunnel A ====
* Upon entering the morph ball tunnel, a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|tall space directly above]] hints that there might be something up there, but as it's above a destructible [[../Visual Hinting|metal box over lava]], reckless bombing will punish the player. If the player has completed the [[#Vault|vault puzzle]], they should [[#Mechanical Hinting|recall the bomb-hopping tech]] from before which is needed to complete the optional trial. Three bomb-hops are necessary to grab the energy tank at the top, and since the metal boxes break (and respawn) after two bombs, the bomb-hops must be performed consecutively.
* Aside from the bomb-hop challenge, this room transitions the player into a new macro-area, thereby ending stage 1 of Magmoor Caverns, and beginning stage 1 of [[#PHENDRANA DRIFTS|Phendrana Drifts]].
%% Morph ball skill check

==== Warrior Shrine ====
* Upon entering from the high foothold in the monitor station, the player can immediately grab a [[../reference#Grand Fetch Quest|Chozo Artifact]], and if they are meticulous they can also [[../reference#Visual Hinting|find on the 3D map]] a morph ball tunnel behind the statue acting as a [[one-way shortcut]] to the [[#Firey Shores|fiery shores]].

==== Magmoor Workstation ====
* An underground morph ball tunnel system has branches filled with molten lava, making them untraversable. However upon scanning a computer panel, it will tell you to [[../reference#Search and Activate to Proceed|locate 3 power conduits]] and activate them. Upon doing so will cause jets to dry lava in one of the branches in the tunnel system, making it accessible. Scanning the panel activates the jets in the next branch, as well as a [[../reference#Timed Consecutive Action Sequence|timer]]. Rinse and repeat two more times to acquire an energy tank.

==== Workstation Tunnel ====
* The [[../reference#Expositional Hinting|bendezium rubble]] blocks access in and out of the hallway, and unless the player has power bombs, they will [[../reference#Teaser|not be able to clear it]].

==== South Core Tunnel ====
* Puddle spores are bio-organic creatures floating in the river of lava. They as a platforms once [[../reference#Shoot and Climb to Proceed|shot and flipped over]].

==== Geothermal Core ====

==== North Core Tunnel ====
* A stalactite hangs above an angry magmoor, and when [[../reference#Shoot and Climb to Proceed|shot with a missile]], will bring it down and kill the magmoor allowing the player to jump and proceed.

==== Twin Fires ====
* Massive pools of lava fill this room, and [[../reference#Teasers|if they had the grapple beam]] they could easily swing across, but overhead stalactites can be [[../reference#Shoot and Climb to Proceed|shot and jumped]] on to progress.
* [[../reference#Yield to Proceed|Wall-equipped flamethrowers]] must be respected and rolled under with morph ball.

=== PHENDRANA DRIFTS ===
[[file:metroidprime_map_phendrana.jpg|>> MAP <<]]
* Phendrana Drifts is the second [[../reference#Macro-area|macro-area]] where the player spends an extended time on. However, the first stage is short-lived, as the player will have to [[backtrack]] to [[#Tallon Canyon|Tallon Overworld]] once they've acquired the boost ball.
* Stage 2 of Phendranda Drifts is likely the most notable stage of this area, as it is the most extensive. It's structured like three branches, with the middle branch being the most distinguishable as a [[linear fetch-and-escape sequence]] for grabbing the thermal visor. The first branch with the player investigating the floating platforms in the [[#Phendrana Shorelines|shorelines]] after having grabbed the space jump boots, eventually leading them to the wave beam. After this, they are meant to find the purple door as seen in the [[#Ice Ruins West|west ice ruins]] which shortly leads into a longer branch from within the space pirate base, and finally the [[#Thardus|final boss]] of the stage that drops the spider ball being the shortest seperate branch.

%% Phendrada depths gravity suit search section features a [[../reference#Linear Fetch-and-escape Sequence|linear fetch-and-escape sequence]] with a series of [[../reference#One-way Valves|one-way valves]]

==== Shoreline Entrance ====
* Several clusters of frozen ice debris impede initial entry, but are quickly and permanently cleaned up with either charge beam or missiles.

==== Phendrana Shorelines ====
* Not unlike Chozo Ruins and Tallon, this [[../reference#Plaza|introductory area opens up quickly]] to a wide open space with several doors and secrets, as well as a lovely pool of water that you can jump into.
* To progress further, the player must locate a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|suspicious metal structure]] within a building to destroy and bypass and [[../reference#Activate to Proceed|scan a panel]] to unlock the door directly above the ceiling. From there, the player must perform a platforming exercise to reach the top of the building to proceed.
* While the keys to unlock the door to progression are blocked behind a metal structure, The save room is straight ahead from the enterance in a wide cave under the platforming secion, [[incentivizing the player somewhat]] to notice the save room first.
* While exploring or platforming especially, the player should [[../reference#Visual Hinting|notice floating platforms]] leading to a distant door atop a tall structure. Attempting to mount these hovering platforms [[../reference#Teaser|proves futile]] at this time, however.
* A missile upgrade [[../reference#Teaser|sits out of reach]] within frozen ice behind a pillar, as it is [[../reference#Expositional Hinting|explained]] that extreme heat is required to melt the ice.
* Upon completing the first stage of Phendrana Drifts, the player backtracks toward the very high cliff connected to the [[#Ice Ruins Access|ice ruins access]], to encounter a cutscene showing the massive shadow of Meta Ridley [[../reference#Visual Hinting|flying past Phendrana's exit]], thereby hinting the player that they are done with this area for now. Luckily, this means the player can merely [[../reference#Streamlining|jump down from here]], greatly streamlining the process of backtracking through this area.
* After completing stage 2 of Tallon Overworld, the player is incentivized to return and re-investigate the floating platforms from before, as they can now be accessed with the double-jump. The platforms will guide the player to another door atop a tall building and into the [[#Temple Entryway|temple entryway]]

==== Ice Ruins Access ====
* Scatter bombus roam the cylindrical halls of this area, with [[../reference#Yield to Proceed|rotating electrical currents]] featuring [[../reference#Visual Hinting|gaps large enough]] to roll through with correct timing to come out unscathed.

==== Ice Ruins East ====
* Sleeping sheegoth babies are brought awake when approached or disturbed, confronting the player with the first basic enemies strong enough to pose a real threat to the player's life. Given that they are similar in nature to the [[#Plated Beetle|plated beetle]] from earlier, the player should have [[../reference#Callback|the necessary skill set]] to fight the pack of two baby sheegoths.
* Baby sheegoths are vulnerable only in their [[../reference#Shrouded Weakspot|exposed backside]], and will generally face the player as to keep it protected, using an aggresive array of both long and short range attacks. Therefore, circle-strafing is an essential strategy. However, once their backside shell has been damaged, they will become [[more aggressive]] in desperation, so they'd best be terminated as soon as possible. Upon death, they can even use cold breath as a [[dying attack]], which if the player is caught in range of will deal some damage and freeze the player, forcing them to [[mash jump]] to escape the ice.

==== Ruins Entryway ====
* After fighting the sheegoth babies from before, a few crates are laid around this room to help replenish health/supplies, but pulse bombus from [[#Hive Totem|before]] have reappeared, and remind the player not only to [[../Yield to Proceed|mind their attacks]], but [[../reference#Callback|refrain from charging ]] your weapon as to not get damaged in the process of replenishing.

==== Ice Ruins West ====
* Besides more baby sheegoths, this room also features the second instance of a [[../reference#Teaser|visible purple door]] perched atop a tall cliff, which is particularly notable at the early stages of the game.
* A [[../reference#Expositional Lore|Chozo lore]] within a ruined building sits atop of- and [[../reference#Visual Hinting|hints the player]] toward- a tall foothold that [[../reference#Teaser|cannot yet be accessed]].
* After returning with the wave beam, the player can now climb the ruined building from before with the double-jump, and upon doing so will come across a [[../Visual Hinting|fractured stalactite]]. Shooting it with a missile will cause it to come down, [[../reference#Shoot and Climb to Proceed|creating a platform]] the player can use to access the purple door and proceed.

==== Phendrana Canyon ====
* Upon entering and dropping down, the player can [[../reference#Activate to Proceed|activate a panel]] to summon a series of floating platforms leading up to the boost ball upgrade that disintegrate once landed upon, thereby [[#../reference#Skill Check|forcing the player to jump swiftly and consecutively]] to attain the upgrade. If failed, the player can walk back up to the panel and retry as needed, but they are [[../reference#One-way Valve|locked from within]] the room until they grab the upgrade and [[#../reference#Skill Check|master using it]] on the half-pipe to land on the foothold that allows them to exit. Once done, the player has completed stage 1 of Phendrana Drifts, and must now backtrack to begin stage 2 of [[#TALLON OVERWORLD|Tallon Overworld]].
* Alternatively, the player can [[../reference#Out-of-box Option|hop back up atop the corners of crates]], assuming they haven't already broken them to reach the exit.

==== Temple Entryway ====
* Upon arriving from the flying platforms, the entryway is guarded by pulse bombus and blocked off by ice debris. The debris can be cleared with either charge beam or missile, but [[#../reference#Callback|charging will attract the bombus]] and damage the player similarly to how [[#Ruins Entryway|another room]] worked.

==== Chozo Ice Temple ====
* Preceded by a platforming exercise, the top of the temple contains four statues and a gate. Scanning them will [[../reference#Expositional Hinting|hint the player]] toward the respective [[../reference#Expositional Hinting|brinstone]] statue to be [[../reference#Search and Activate to Proceed|broken and activated]] to unlock the gate to proceed and face the [[#Sheegoth|boss]].
* Next to the gate sits a chozo statue [[../reference#Teaser|frozen in ice]].
* After defeating the boss and returing, [[../reference#Backtrack Filler|bombus patrol the room]] and can [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|now be defeated]] with the newly-acquired wave beam.

==== Ruined Courtyard ====
* Upon entering, two morph ball spinners [[../reference#Consecutive Action Sequence|must be activated]] to open the floodgates and turn on the morph ball bomb slot. Once activated, [[../reference#Environmental Transformation|water floods the room and raises the snowy platforms]] and a [[../reference#Timed Action Sequence|timed platforming exercise]] to the top commences. Flickerbats routinely fly near the platforms and can knock the player off if they don't kill them first.
* During the exercise a morph ball tunnel containing an energy tank is hinted at with a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|glowing rim]]. The lower part of the platform is tapered so that a double-jump is optimal for climbing it. Once the energy tank is acquired, the timed action and transformation sequences must be repeated to reach the top and proceed.
* A [[../reference#Expositional Hinting|cordite]] insignia hangs over an inactive door, but is [[../reference#Teaser|unbreakable]] at this time.
* After grabbing the thermal visor and returning from the space pirate base, the player can now return to the [[../reference#Callback|inactive door]] use the super missile to break the cordite insignia and shoot the hidden power conduit that was behind it and proceed through the door and challenge the [[#Thardus|boss]].

==== Specimen Storage ====
* A defense turret as well as a shadow pirate- a [[../reference#Cloaking|semi-cloaked space pirate]]- greet the player upon entering. The cloaking device on the pirate inhibits the player's ability to lock on to the target until they are close enough to reveal themselves.

==== Research Entrance ====
* A space pirate ambush awaits the player upon entering, having not seen them since they were crippled in the early game. Learning the fastest way to kill them takes some experimentating with charge beam/missile combinations.
* A map room sits in the corner, revealing the entirety of the space pirate base once downloaded.

==== Research Lab Hydra ====
* A [[../reference#Expositional Hinting|cordite]] plated chamber [[../reference#Teaser|cannot be destroyed yet]], but upon returning with the super missiles allows the player to grab the missile expansion inside.
* During the escape sequence, the player can use thermal imaging to spot [[../reference#Visual Hinting|shadow pirates hanging from the ceiling]] to shoot them preemptively.

==== Observatory Access ====
* Upon entering from a vertical door, the player is greeted with stacked crates with turrets behind them, with [[../reference#Visual Hinting|light bouncing off the walls]] to signify that they're there. If activated by proximity, the turrets can [[blast open the crates]] and shoot the player.

==== Observatory ====
* To initialize the [[../reference#Consecutive Action Sequence|holographic sequence]], the player must find and scan a computer to activate the nearby bomb slot. Once activated, the player must perform a small platforming exercise to reach the secondary bomb slot which activates a series of 4 morph ball spinners located in the center of the room. Once the spinners have been activated, the holographic observatory will become online, and some platforms connected to the walls will [[../reference#Environmental transformation|protrude outward]] for them to be possible to climb and reach the top of the room, thereby rewarding the player with super missiles.

==== Control Tower ====
* An arena filled with destructible crates used for both supplies and cover fill this room while fighting both grounded and airborne space pirates.
* A window within one of the towers contains a stack of crates with a frozen window behind it, but it [[../reference#Teaser|cannot be melted]] at this point in time.

==== Research Lab Aether ====
* A tank containing a metroid [[../reference#Activate to Proceed|requires to be scanned]] [[../reference#Shoot to Proceed|or shot]] for the metroid to then escape and attack the player. Once defeated, a space pirate will [[../reference#Environmental Transformation|jump through the window]] and subsequently allow the player to continue.
* A suspended morph ball track above the ceiling contains no side rails, but if the player can [[../reference#Skill Check|successfully roll across]] it without falling off they will be rewarded with a missile expansion.
* An energy tank [[../reference#Visual Hinting|within one of the chambers]] at the bottom floor requires the player to shoot it with a missile to grab it, restoring their health completely.
* A vertical door in the corner of the room requires the pile of crates atop it to be [[../reference#Shoot to Proceed|destroyed]] before continuing.
* Upon returning with the thermal visor, the defense turrets are [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|practically invisible to thermal imaging]].

==== Research Core Access ====
* Insignificant ice beetles occupy this room initially, but upon escaping from the locked [[#Research Core|research core]], they are [[../reference#Backtrack Filler|replaced with sentry drones]], aggressive flying mechanical enemies only [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|faintly visible with thermal imaging]] due to their lack of biological heat signature. They lock the doors until defeated and explode with an EMP blast upon death.

==== Research Core ====
* At the bottom of the room lies a tank containing the thermal visor that must be unlocked by [[../reference#Search and Activate to Proceed|finding and scanning]] three different computers within the room, but it can also be somewhat used as a protective pillar to avoid blasts from the defense turrets guarding the bottom floor.
* Once the thermal visor has been acquired, the entirety of the space pirate base will become pitch-black, severely limiting vision, and a crew of shadow pirates ambush the player. With the newly-found thermal visor, the player can see in the dark and detect [[../reference#Cloaking|thermal heat signatures]] on enemies- cloaked or otherwise.
* A white door also at the bottom floor [[../reference#Teaser|blocks any further entry]] into this area at this time.
* Upon going upstairs, [[../reference#Backtrack Filler|captive metroids]] will escape from the walls and attack the player.
* When reaching the top after grabbing the thermal visor, the entrance door does nothing, signifying that it is inactive. By locating a [[../reference#Search and Activate to Proceed|nearby power conduit]] that's [[../reference#Cloaking|only visible with thermal imaging]] and shooting it with the wave beam, the door [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|becomes active]].

==== Transport to Magmoor Caverns South ====
* Upon entering, a spider ball track can be followed up to a white door, but that's as far as the player will go go [[../reference#Teaser|without the ice beam]] to open it.

==== Quarantine Cave ====
* Both tunnel entrances to the cave are occupied with bombus that the player must respect and [[../reference#Yield to Proceed|time correctly]] within morph ball to get through unscathed.

== BOSSES ==

=== Parasite Queen ===

=== Hive Mecha ===
* Hive-mecha fight requires killing increasingly present mobile enemies on a small circular arena surrounded by [[../reference#Ring-out|toxic acid]] and tracking them with [[radar]] and [[../reference#Audible Hinting|audio queues]] to expose the weak-point of stationary boss. Rinse and repeat three times to win and acquire the missile launcher.

=== Plated Beetle ===
* The boss fight begins with the player fighting [[../reference#Mobs|many regular beetles]] at once in the arena until enough are killed to summon the plated beetle.
* The plated beetle encourages player to use the dodge ability [[../reference#Visual Hinting|at the correct time]] to [[../reference#Circle-strafing|circle around the enemy]] to shoot its [[../reference#Backside Weakspot|exposed backside]]

=== Incinerator Drone ===
* Incinerator drone fight requires you to jump and duck past the boss's [[../reference#Circle-strafing|circular attack pattern]] and to shoot the [[../reference#Peakaboo Weakspot|temporarily exposed weak point]] while dealing with [[../reference#Minions|increasingly present weaker enemies]]

=== Flahgraa ===
* Flahgraa fight requires you to quickly shoot increasingly present solar panels (1-4) to [[incapacitate the boss]] in order to damage it. Rinse and repeat four times to defeat Flahgraa.
* The boss attacks with projectile and melee weapons, but cannot move from the center. It will also attempt to deactivate the targets you've shot, but to counter this, you can shoot the boss to [[temporarily stun]] it.
* [[../reference#Circle-strafing|Circle strafing]] and dashing with the lock-on is a useful strategy.

=== Sheegoth ===
* The fight begins with fighting [[../reference#Mobs|several baby sheegoth]] before summoning the big one. The chambers where the babies were being kept hold crates that can be broken mid-battle to assist the player.
* Sheegoth requires you to attack the mouth or underside with concussive weapons like missiles, bombs or boost ball. Using your energy weapon while locked on will redirect the shot and become [[absorbed by the boss]] to charge its long range attack.

=== Thardus ===
* Thardus requires you to [[../reference#Dynamic Weakspot|locate its weak-point]] with thermal visor, attack it, then switch back to normal visor and target the same point to destroy that point. Rinse and repeat. [[../reference#Aesthetic Presentation|(Some weather effects too)]]

== THOUGHTS ==
* I think that given the task Retro Studios was given with, they hit the nail on the head making Metroid's debut in 3D, and filling in Super Metroid's shoes. Although not perfect, Prime serves as a great first-person action/adventure game - and perhaps the only of its kind - with such a heavy focus on the MV formula. The atmosphere just great.

=== Game Feel ===
* I think there was lots of thought put into the level design from the micro to the macro level. The levels and areas flow together nicely all things considered, and the emphasis on exploration and encouraging the player to check back on the things they were blue-balled on before was pretty good. Although it does a good job at honoring Super Metroids design philosophy and atmosphere, the game feel leaves some to be desired- as it is after all a single-stick first-person shooter, and silky, satisfying movement mechanics would have been much harder (if not impossible) to implement. The targeting system does its best to keep things smooth, but looking around can feel somewhat stiff and slow at times. (I think a sensitivity slider would help to remedy this). Platforming while not bad by any means, isn't nearly as smooth and satisfying as in Super Metroid.

=== Morph Ball ===
* The morph ball mechanic adds a whole new dimension of mobility, combat and puzzle-solving, in these games so much so that I find it underappreciated/overlooked.

=== Streamlining ===
* Although the flow between levels is generally good, I would've maybe liked it if there were more breakable or uncoverable shortcuts to make traveling even more streamlined across areas than they already were. In this way I feel like the grapple beam is underutilized, as it is a prime candidate for this job, but it is also just fun to use. I think it would've been viable to use something other than strictly the "grapple points" as use for the grapple beam, such as maybe some more natural or mechanical elements that fit the environment you're in. I think the spider ball could've been used more often too, especially in some of those slower morph ball-only sections.

* I think more ice beam doors could've been used to streamline the space pirate base in Phendrana Drifts for when the player comes back later to hunt for the gravity suit and Chozo artifacts. For example, what if there was an ice door that divides the entrance of the facility from the main path into an underground "under construction" area that leads directly into both the [[#Control Tower|control tower]] elevator and the [[#Research Core|research core]]. This way, the player would be more heavily incentivized to remember and check it out later after they acquire the ice beam, instead of relying on just the one white door in the research core and the [[elevator]] to remind them.

=== Powerups ===
* Most of the extra/optional powerups aren't particularly exciting/efficient - as in they mainly consist of 5-stock missile expansions to add to your massive stockpile of missiles (which is nice, but at some point it becomes like a diminishing returns effect) and power bomb expansions which really don't serve much of a purpose besides breaking certain walls and saying "fuck it" to enemies that you just want to deal with quickly and get over with, and considering how easy it is for power bomb refills to drop from enemies anyway, these expansions really don't feel like they serve much of a meaningful purpose at all. There's also the elemental super missiles for each respective beam weapon, but the vanilla super missile is simply the most efficient in terms of both effectiveness and ammo efficiency in the vast majority of cases, so the other ones are really just "meh" even if they're kinda cool.

=== The Hint System and the Metroidvania Problem ===
%% The metroidvania problem ... (Process of elimination, how often people blatantly miss things/make mistakes over an extended time ... and is most likely why the hint system was implemented in the first place)

=== Repetition ===
* One thing that slightly bothered me is the repetitive use of particular enemies in sometimes in early/mid game (Flying Pirates and Shriekbats in particular get overused) and in some instances of the game the topography feels too similar (cylindrical access tunnels get used alot early/mid-game).

=== Design Flaws ===
* I do question the game's ability to point the player in the right direction at a couple points in the game. In this way, I think the developers relied too much on the hint system to mask flaws in the level design. Two examples stick out to me and those are the half-pipe in Tallon Overworld and sunken frigate entrance after grabbing the ice beam. I understand why the developers included the hint system- to guide players who inevitably get lost to their next progression point without giving _too_ much information away on how to get there (most of the time). I just think that most of the items and progression points did this well enough on their own without the need for the hint system, while a select few did not.

%% Phendrana Drifts save room thing...

%% Magmoor backtracking thing...

* The half-pipe example requires the player to go _all_ the way back to Tallon Overworld after acquiring the boost ball to locate a specific and easy to miss half-pipe that is required to get the space jump boots. It's not the backtracking itself that particularly bothers me, it's just that the answer the boost ball is too obtuse on its own (without the hint) to justify its design choice, I think.
%% Although there are subtle design choices and hints guiding the player toward this area...
%% visually it doesn't communicate well because of the dark, the sheer width, the enemies drawing the player's focus instead of the shape of the structure, and the fact that the structure never stood out to the player originally since it was merely in the beginning of the game

* The most egregious example of this comes mid-game after the ice beam is acquired. Once the spider ball is acquired, you are greeted with an ice door upon entering the next elevator room. This ice door was to serve as the main hint on where to go after acquiring the ice beam shortly after. Or perhaps even the ice door in the research core. The problem is that these doors are easy to ignore and forget, and on top of that- once acquiring the ice beam- you are given two more paths to explore immediately. One leads to Magmoor Caverns for optional stuff, and the other leads to the entrance to the sunken frigate which is also blocked by an ice door. If the player enters the frigate before going back to Phendrana Drifts to grab the gravity suit, then they will have to though a slog of underwater scavenger hunting and platforming only to be told to go straight back all the way up from where they came. This blatant flaw easily could've been fixed in a couple ways just off the top of my head. One way is to move the door that drops you into the frigate crash site from Chozo Ruins _behind_ the body of water, that way the player is still gatekept by that instead of given premature access to the frigate. Another way to solve this is to simply put a door early on in the frigate that's inaccessible to anyone without the gravity suit, so that the player doesn't get premature access to the reactor core and cargo freight just to trek back in the most crude way possible- being explicitly told to.

%% Other magmoor backtracking thing...

* Another blemish with the level design in this game which I particularly disliked (disregarding the no-hint stuff), was retrieving the artifact of newborn. I feel like the fix would be very simply to put it closer to the entrance/exit point of the area that its in (being the Phazon Mines depths) instead of being right in the awkward middle area that its in, and given that there isn't a backtrack-phase in that area like the other artifacts because its the very end of the game, there's no real way to go back and get it that doesn't feel like a real slog.
%% However, going back through the unlocked gate... If there was a phazon tunnel thing in the middle maybe...

%% Door color thing... beam swapping thing...
