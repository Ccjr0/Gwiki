== GENERAL/OVERVIEW ==
* Bosses gruadually [[../reference#Visual Hinting|shift color hues]] to reflect their health status.
* A 2-Dimensional map in the top right of the status HUD shows the player's position in relation to the world around them, as well as automatically graphs out as the player explores areas they've never been.
* Points of interest are [[../reference#Visual Hinting|noted with a dot]] (.) in the middle of the square representing the general area. These points of interest typically include powerups, but can also include health/ammo stations, and boss rooms. Elevators are marked with a dash (-) symbol. The player's last known save point is highlighted with a special 'S' icon, distinct from the other save rooms.
* Doors that have been locked upon entry, but unlocked after completing a local task (typically killing enemies) will [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|flash to reflect their status]].
* Shutters act as [[../reference#One-way Valves|one-way gates]], as they can only be opened from one side. The color-coded buttons correspond with basic doors to reflect the weapon requirements needed for activation. These shutters automatically close when the player leaves the room and returns.
* Doors typically lock themselves until all [[enemies within a given room are defeated]].
* Hi-jump boots expand the player's standard maximum jump height, allowing for reaching higher footholds as well as [[../reference#Streamline Ability|faster vertical traversal]].
* Spazer beam greatly expands the width of the standard beam fire, making killing small/agile enemies much easier, as well as a considerable increase in firepower.
%% Save station entries geometrically streamlined...
%% Power bombs can quickly clear lots of bombable blocks caught within its radius...
%% Techniques like wall jumps, mach ball, shinespark etc retroactively change the game...

[[#CERES STATION|Ceres Station]]
[[#CRATERIA|Crateria]]
[[#BRINSTAR|Brinstar]]
[[#NORFAIR|Norfair]]
[[#WRECKED SHIP|Wrecked Ship]]
[[#MARIDIA|Maridia]]
[[#TOURIAN|Tourian]]

=== CERES STATION ===
* This temporary macro-area serves as a very [[../reference#Basic Mechanical Tutorial|short and basic tutorial section]] helping the player to get accustomed to the controls and establish the plot.
* After surviving the first encounter with [[#Ridley I|Ridley]],

==== Ridley's Room ====
* Upon meeting the captive metroid in the middle of the room, [[#Ridley I|Ridley]] emerges from the darkness in the background to engage the player in a battle.

----

=== CRATERIA ===
* Crateria's first stage starts with the player landing on Zebes to begin crawling down the deserted cavern west of the landing site and eventually entering [[#BRINSTAR|Brinstar]] to initiate its first stage.
* Stage 2 involves climbing back up how they came in after stage 1 Brinstar and exploring the Parlor and Alcatraz and its adjacent rooms with the newly acquired morph ball and missile launcher to eventually obtain the bombs necessary to branch off into Brinstar's second stage. The first map room right across from the final missile bombway should hint the player toward the right directions should they get confused.

==== Landing Site ====
* Upon landing, the player is confronted with an east/west split to begin exploration. On the east side, a [[../reference#Teasers|high-above foothold]] can be seen, but is too high to reach. A suspicious [[../reference#Teasers|rock blockage]] also fills a tunnel, but nothing can be done at this time. The cave on the west side holds the door to progression.
* Immediately after having acquired the bombs during stage 2, the blockage can easily be investigated and successfully cleared with bombs, but the player will quickly meet another dead-end, as a [[../reference#Teasers|green door]] halts their progress shortly after the tunnel, and without tools necessary to bypass it the player must retreat.
* After finally returning through what used to be an impassable green door from the [[#Crateria Kihunter Room|kihunter room]], the player comes full circle back to the mothership where they first landed. From here, the player can choose to head straight back through red brinstar or go through the whole roundabout again through blue/green brinstar with the newly-acquired items necessary to uncover the secrets in they were withheld from them long before.

==== Parlor and Alcatraz ====
* The player is met with several [[../reference#Teasers|inaccessible tunnelways]] while they enter the room and as descend down the platforms of the cavern. Ambient bugs also [[../reference#PRESENTATION|scatter away]] in the background when disturbed during the first stage. A door [[../reference#Teasers|sealed behind a small tunnel]] can be seen while descending, as well as two opposite doors below that: one blue and one red. However, the [[../reference#Teasers|red door is currently inaccessible]], and while the room behind the blue door is, nothing useful can be done [[#Final Missile Bombway|there]] at this point. The only way clear way forward is the blue door heading [[#Climb|downward]].
* The once deserted cavern is now occupied with geemers crawling along the walls and platforms. The player is inclined to [[../reference#Basic Mechanical Tutorial|exercise their shooting abilities]], making use of the up, down, and diagonal shots to dispatch them. The first two rooms on the [[#Pre-Map Flyway|east]] and [[#Final Missile Bombway|west]] upon coming back up can now be expored further with the morph ball and missile launcher. The door clearly behind the tunnel seen before can also be accessed, revealing a save station.
* After going far enough back up, one of the tunnelways seen upon immediately entering in stage 1 can be accessed, leading underground and locking the player within "Alcatraz", until they have acquired bombs going [[#Flyway|forward]].
* After having acquired bombs, the player returns with the means to be able to escape Alcatraz through the ball tunnel leading out by bombing the rubble blocking passage, leading back to the very entrance of the room. The [[../reference#Visual Hinting|suspicious looking rocks]] at the end of the top hallway hint that there may be more than what meets the eye, as well as the map indications showing that there is something behind there. Indeed, the plot thickens once the player bombs away at the rocks, revealing the [[#Terminator Room|progression forward]].

==== Final Missile Bombway ====
* Upon entering in stage 1 Crateria, the player's options are highly limited, as they are immediately gatekept by a [[../reference#Teasers|small tunnel]], which cannot be entered until the morph ball is obtained.
* After completing Brinstar stage 2 and acquiring the morph ball and missile launcher, the player can re-enter the room and access the tunnel, but they are quickly stopped short by [[../reference#Teasers|blockage filling the tunnel]], and will have to retreat unless they've acquired bombs to [[#The Final Missile|reach the end]].
* After coming back through from grabbing the so called "[[#The Final Missile|final missile]]", the player may be inclined to simply hold right as they bomb their way back through the tunnel, but in doing so will discover a hidden invisible tunnel within the wall, allowing [[../reference#Streamlining|quick and easy access]] over the rubble and plopping them back near the entrance door.

==== Climb ====
* A very long series of platforms of various sizes are laid across the entirety of the tall, narrow room. The first time entering, the player can slowly descend upon the platforms, but keeping to the side [[../reference#Streamlining|speeds things up]] as there is a long stretch of open space.
* Space pirates infest the room upon returning from the [[#Pit Room|pit room]]. The player must climb their way up the [[../reference#Basic Mechanical Tutorial|long series of small platforms]], with space pirates climbing on the walls and firing projectiles.
* A secret tunnel next to the only direct side-mounted platform at the bottom of the room can be discovered [[../reference#Novelty Option|should the player feel inclined to bomb it]], revealing a yellow door allowing access to the [[#Crateria Super Room|room beyond]] only to those wielding power bombs.

==== Pit Room ====
* This room contains a consecutive series of platforms and pillars for the player to [[../reference#Basic Mechanical Tutorial|exercise their platforming consistency]] on. Upon the player's first arrival here, the [[../reference#One-way Valves|entrance locks itself]], sealing the player within. An elevator leading down to [[#BRINSTAR|Brinstar]] awaits the player at the far east end.
* Upon returning after acquiring both the morph ball and missile launcher, the lights turn on, and space pirates have [[../reference#Backtrack Filler|infested the room]]. They are relatively weak, and take only one shot to dispatch. They occupy the platforms needed to cross the room, and sometimes climb on walls. After [[defeating all of them]], the doors in the room will unlock, allowing the player to continue backtracking.
* Should the player return here with bombs and opt to [[../reference#Novelty Option|bomb the center of ruined glass tube]], they will uncover a small chamber beneath containing a missile expansion.

==== Pre-Map Flyway ====
* Several mellows and a reo occupy the hallway. While the mellows are merely basic fly enemies, the reo takes multiple hits to kill and will bounce along the ceiling, making it a more challenging foe, although a single missile shot will make instant work of it.
* The Crateria [[map room]] is just behind the door at the end of the hallway. With it, the player can find rooms they haven't explored (marked in blue), and get an idea of where they need to go next.

==== Flyway ====
* A large [[../reference#Cluster Enemies|swarm of mellows]] occupy the hallway leading to a red door, where five missiles must be spent to access it. The mellows can merely be run past swiftly to avoid combat altogether, but their numbers can [[../reference#Farming Mobs|drop the missiles necessary]] both to open the door, and replenish health/ammo when coming out if need be. A meticulous player may even opt to [[../reference#Novelty Option|open the door first]], and then fight the flies to replenish the health/missiles used. Doing so may prove useful within the [[#Bomb Torizo Room|proceeding room]].

==== Bomb Torizo Room ====
* Upon entering, the player is met with another Chozo statue holding an upgrade, that being bombs. The [[../reference#One-way Valves|door is locked]] quickly upon trying to leave, and the statue comes to life to reveal the hostile [[#Torizo|Torizo]] ready to engage in combat.
%% Swift movement and arm-pumping can be utilized to escape prematurely...

==== The Final Missile ====
* After having acquired bombs necessary to clear through the blocked tunnel, the player is greeted by a Chozo statue holding another missile expansion.

==== Terminator Room ====
* Several basic enemies occupy the downward sloping room, but so does the player's "first" energy tank, expanding the players maximum HP as well as full HP restoration.
* The placement of enemies within the room [[../reference#Streamlining|compliments the use of the speed booster]], should the player return through either end of the room after having acuired it.

==== Green Pirates Shaft ====
* As the name implies, [[../reference#Visual Hinting|green space pirates]] occupy the staggered decent of the room. They are [[../reference#Selective Invulnerability|immune to regular weapons fire]], but a single missile does the job nicely, but two carefully placed bombs can also be used in a pinch. Their projectile attack is effective against standing enemies, but the morph ball is an effective evasive maneuver. At the bottom of the room lies both a [[#Lower Mushrooms|blue]] and [[#Golden Statues Room|red]] door opposite to each other.

==== Golden Statues Room ====
* A mossy green cove with a lake and a massive golden statue make this room [[../reference#Significant Landmarking|stand out from all others]] in the game, not to mention the long abandoned hallway leading up to it, signifying an unknown importance. The statue depicts four creatures, each with their own glowing colored eye. If none of the bosses have been defeated up until the room is discovered, nothing will happen and the player can merely take notice.
* Should the player return after having defeated one of the bosses depicted in the statue, the respective part of the statue will turn grey, affirming that all bosses must be defeated to complete the task presented by the room.

==== Lower Mushrooms ====
* Upon entering, the player encounters an armor plated geemer only [[../reference#Selective Invulnerability|vulnerable to bomb attacks]], as well as the first instance of a kago- a nest-like bio-organism. When disturbed with weapon fire, the kago will [[../reference#Generator|gradually dispense small jumping bugs]] that can [[../reference#Farming Mobs|drop health/ammo]] when killed. With enough weapons fire, the kago will be destroyed. Following the door ahead will lead to an elevator leading to green [[#BRINSTAR|Brinstar]], ending stage 2 of Crateria.

==== Crateria Kihunter Room ====
* After bypassing the yellow door proceeding the [[#Caterpillar Room|caterpillar room]], The player ascends up a series of platforms to shoot hole through the thin ceiling to reveal an east/west fork. The blue door on the west leads back to the [[#Landing Site|landing site]], while the yellow door to the east leads to [[#The Moat|the moat]].

==== The Moat ====
*

==== Blue Brinstar Boulder Room ====

==== Billy Mays Room ====

==== Crateria Super Room ====
* The room consists of a long hallway with a staggered series of buyons along the floor that must be sequentially frozen in place swiftly enough to be able to speed back and over them to then perform a shinespark up the [[../reference#Callback|tall shaft]] that holds a super missile expansion. Although merely the ice beam is required to freeze the boyons, the stacked plasma beam makes [[../reference#Streamlining|quicker work of the job]]. Once completed, the exit door lies across a long pit of spikes with grapple points lining the ceiling. Unless the player had acquired it by this point, they will have to take damage as they run across the spikes to reach the exit leading back to the top end [[#Climb|climb]].




----

=== BRINSTAR ===
* Stage 1 involves getting the morph ball and missile launcher after coming down from the Craterian elevator proceeding the [[#Pit Room|pit room]].
* Stage 2 begins upon taking the elevator room proceeding the lower mushrooms and spits the player out into the grassy [[#Green Brinstar Main Shaft|green brinstar]]. This stage of the game contains harder foes in higher numbers, so the missile expansions and E-tanks collected in Crateria will come into fruition here. After defeating the first boss in green Brinstar, the stage continues as the player descends further down into red Brinstar, and should eventually end up at the elevator room to begin the [[#NORFAIR|Norfair]] adventure.
* Stage 3 begins after acquiring the hi-jump boots and returning to the elevator with the scary face to explore the warehouse and defeat Kraid, obtaining the varia suit in the process.
* Stage 4 is relatively short, but marks a crucial point in the game where the player returns with the ice beam to finally climb back up the red tower and retrieve the power bombs having been locked within the [[#Caterpillar Room|caterpillar room]]. Afterwards, the player is also inclined to unlock the shortcut leading back to Crateria, thereby completing the first lap of the macro-circuit.

==== Morph Ball Room ====
* Arriving from the descending elevator, the player is again met with an east/west decision on how they will proceed.
* On the west side, of the room, the morph ball can be seen glowing on a pedestal past a structure that will [[../reference#One-way Valves|trap the player from within]], ensuring that they will grab it. Once acquired, they cannot simply escape through the way the came since the structure is too high, but a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|suspicious blue block]] seals a small tunnel. Upon shooting the block, the player can activate the newly-acquired morph ball to escape beneath the structure.
* The [[../reference#Visual Hinting|background can be seen moving through the cracks]] behind the west wall where the morph ball had been stationed, and should the player return to the room from either side being the elevator or [[#Green Hill Zone|green brinstar]] with the power bomb, a tunnel can be blasted open allowing [[../reference#Streamlining|shortcut access through green/blue brinstar]] as well as a power bomb expansion in the middle of the tunnel.
%% Eye-camera thing...

==== Construction Zone ====
* The door across the room on the east side is [[../reference#Teasers|guarded with a red barrier]], and cannot be bypassed at first arrival. The blocks filling the center of the room are of a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|distinct shade of blue]], and will disintegrate upon being shot. Discovering this, the player can shoot their way to the bottom of the room, but unless they have acquired the morph ball from the [[#Morph Ball Room|room prior]], they [[../reference#Teasers|cannot bypass the tunnel]] that leads to the door on the lower floor, and will have to climb back up.
* After acquiring the missile launcher from the [[#First Missile Room|missile room]], the player can immediately access the red door from before and proceed [[#Blue Brinstar Energy Tank Room|forward]].

==== First Missile Room ====
* Upon arriving with the morph ball from the [[#Construction Zone|room prior]], the player will be met with a room with merely a chozo statue holding a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|glowing orb]]. Being inclined to shoot the orb reveals the missile launcher. With it, the player has unlocked the ability to unlock red doors at a one-time fee of 5 missiles per door.

==== Blue Brinstar Energy Tank Room ====
* After dealing with some basic enemies, tunnel below a column at the far-east end of the room reveals a missile expansion on the other side, increasing the maximum missile capacity by 5, extra missiles included.
* For those inclined to return later (typically through the [[#Morph Ball Room|green/blue shortcut]]), the column structure looks somewhat suspicious as a couple of black empty blocks within it seem to roughly outline something. Upon using a power bomb nearby, the bottom of the structure will blast away giving space to walk in and discover that the outline is hollow, and can be jumped straight into. Should the player be [[../reference#Callback|reminded of the shinespark tutorial]] found within the dachora room, they can perform one to access the secret room high above and through the column.
* A well-hidden energy tank within a single block lining the ceiling can be accidentally uncovered by means of weapons fire when dealing with enemies, a power bomb to the left of the destructible column, the x-ray scope, or even just sheer dumb luck. The tank also happens to compliment the shine-sparking ability intended to reach the secret room above, as it will refill all health upon grabbing it.
%% Another eye-camera thing...
%% Energy tank can be acquired with bomb-hopping technique...

==== Green Brinstar Main Shaft ====
[[file:GreenBrinstarMainShaft.png|{IMG}]]
* Similar in nature to the [[#Parlor and Alcatraz|parlor]], the player will slowly descend upon platforms with several red doors on opposing sides giving the player choices on where to go. Instead of the measly geemers, zeelas crawl around the walls and platforms and take two shots to dispatch instead of 1.
* At the bottom of the shaft, a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|thin layer separates an open space]] beneath the floor, and the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|zeela crawling around the area]] somewhat helps bring notice to that, however attempting to bomb the floor will reveal [[../reference#Symbolic Hinting|special blocks that require a weapon]] the player does not have access to at the time.
* Once returning with the power bombs, the player can blast open the bridge at the bottom of the shaft to reveal another tall shaft below the main one with a locked door at the top end and a [[#Green Brinstar Beetom Room|single blue door]] at the bottom.

==== Brinstar Pre-Map Room ====
* Northwest-adjacent to the [[#Green Brinstar Main Shaft|main shaft]], the player is confronted with a small sidehopper bouncing along the ceiling, taking three hits to dispatch, as well as a few zeelas crawling along the ground before reaching what appears to be a dead end. If the player were to try and leave the room at this point, they would notice that the [[../reference#One-way Valves|entrance has been locked]], forcing the player to solve the room. Although nothing appears to be wrong to the naked eye, the way the way the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|wall/floor behind the dead end]] continues in combination with the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|camera position]] seems suspicious. Bombing the wall reveals that [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|it is indeed destructible]], and the path forward opens up, as well as the final zeela hidden behind the secret to unlock the doors and allow the player through.
* Past the secret lies the door containing the [[map room]], conveniently placed within the upper-level of the shaft.

==== Early Supers Room ====
[[file:EarlySupersRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* Northeast-adjacent to the [[#Green Brinstar Main Shaft|main shaft]], the early supers room consists of a long, flat platform splitting the room with a few support pillars below it. A pipe coming out of the ground [[../reference#Generator|slowly generates zebs]] one-by-one when approached. While moving along the platform, the ground in the middle will disintegrate, sending a walking player down between the pillars where a missile expansion can be grabbed. From there, the bottom of the left pillar can be destroyed with a bomb to exit and try again. Even when successfully running along the fragile blocks however, a [[../reference#Teasers|proximity shutter]] is ready to automatically close the player off from continuing along the platform. The next pillar containing sidehoppers can be accessed, revealing that [[../reference#Teasers|even more shutters]] past the one, but nothing can be done to bypass the third and final pillar. Nothing at all the player can do can destroy the shutters at this time, and the player is forced to head back.
* Upon returning after having acquired the speed booster, the player can try again and successfully speed past the proximity shutters and reveal a [[#Brinstar Reserve Tank Room|red door]] at the end of the room.
* When coming back after obtaining the reserve tank, the proximity shutter at the end of the room closes activates as soon as the room is re-entered, [[../reference#One-way Valves|trapping them within]]. A [[../reference#distinct pair of blocks]] lining the ceiling just above the gate reveals an escape route through the ceiling filled with enemies as well as a super missile expansion which, once acuired, the pedestal it stood on will crumble, dropping the player back to the main entrance of the room allowing them to leave.
%% Mockball technique to acquire early super missiles...

==== Green Brinstar Fireflea Room ====
[[file:GreenBrinstarFirefleaRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* A faint glow produced by firefleas keeps the whole room alit. Killing one [[../reference#Termination|makes the room darker]] as a result, and killing enough of them will make it very hard or impossible to see the platforms to jump on and spikes to avoid, leaving only the player and doors easily visible.
* A missile refill station awaits the player past the door at the end of the room, and will also reset the firefleas if need be. On the way back through the room, players will be especially punished for killing firefleas recklessly on their way back to the [[#Green Brinstar Main Shaft|shaft]].

==== Dachora Room ====
[[file:DachoraRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* After dealing with a hallway of enemies, the player meets what seems to be a dead end at the end of the hall, but the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|shadows on the other side]] of the wall look suspicious. The player can in fact use bombs to clear a path through. By now, this process [[../reference#Conditioning|should train the player]] into knowing that not all destructible blocks are distinct to the naked eye, and brute force may work when all else fails.
* A [[../reference#Visual Hinting|thin bridge structure with distinctly square blocks]] occupies the space just outside of the destructible wall, but upon bombing it reveals blocks that signify a weapon/ability the player [[../reference#Teasers|does not have]].

==== Big Pink ====
[[file:BigPink.png|{IMG}]]
* Upon entering, the player is immediately granted the option to pick up/down to explore the layered micro-areas of the room. The room is crawling with several fast and strong enemies, so having missiles on deck would prove useful here, and smooth morph ball maneuvers can be used to avoid getting hit. The area is also full of [[../reference#Generators|basic enemy generators]] to help [[../reference#Farming Mobs|slowly replenish]] health/ammo.
* Heading down from the main entrance, the player is first greeted with a [[../reference#Teasers|foothold they cannot jump high enough to reach]] with a missile expansion barely within view sitting atop of it. A two sidehoppers and a trap-door await those at the bottom of the foothold, sending them further down into a pit of two aggressive reos. The only thing notable about how the foothold might be reached is a series of [[../reference#Visual Hinting|distinct blocks lining the ceiling]], but [[../reference#Teasers|nothing can be made of them]] at the time.
* On the way out of the trap-door pit, the [[../reference#Teasers|first yellow door]] can be seen on the east side, but the player can merely take notice of it.
* At the bottom of the room, lies a missile expansion as well as a tunnel within a column. The [[../reference#Visual Hinting|cornerstone of the column]] looks highly suspicious, and bombing it will bring the player down into a cove containing a chozo statue holding the charge beam. With it, stronger enemies can be taken care of more efficiently without the cost of missiles. Past the tunnel within the column [[../reference#Teasers|lies a green door]], forcing the player to climb back up the room. Meticulous/conditioned players may opt to [[../reference#Novelty Option|bomb the cornerstone of the statue]] to [[../reference#Teasers|reveal an impassable block]] seen in the floor of the [[#Green Brinstar Main Shaft|main shaft]].
* Towards the top of the room, a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|protrusion in the wall]] with what looks to be a blocked tunnel suggests that it can be explored, and upon doing so will reveal a save room. Along the right side of the top will reveal the door to [[progression]].
* After unlocking and accessing the [[#Spore Spawn Farming Room|first green door]] with the newly-acquired super missiles, the player enters a cave with a blocked-off tunnel. Bombing the rubble will reveal a super missile block. Shooting it will [[../reference#Circuit|loop the player back]] just above where the column was containing the other green door to progression was.
* Upon returning after having recently learned the walljump, the foothold from before still cannot be reached easily merely with hi-jump boots. The side wall of the foothold however is [[../reference#Callback|aligned appropriately to suit a walljump maneuver]].

==== Spore Spawn Kihunter Room ====
* Three kihunters roam the hallway preceding the [[#Spore Spawn|boss]] room. The kihunters are large, flying creatures dealing a fair bit of damage that swoop to attack. They normally take six shots to kill, and missiles will quickly dispatch them in one hit, but so will the charge beam if the player has acquired it from the bottom of [[#Big Pink|big pink]] at the cost of 0 missiles.

==== Spore Spawn Super Room ====
* After defeating the [[#Spore Spawn|boss]], the player is led to a room with two pipes, one being a simple [[../reference#Generators|generator]] to help [[../reference#Farming Mobs|replenish]] after the fight, and the other at the end room being a trap-door that the player is inclined to step on. A very long fall down a narrow corridor ends with a Chozo statue holding the super missile upgrade, giving the player 5.

==== Spore Spawn Farming Room ====
* After acquiring the super missiles, the player is brought to a room full of more pipe generators and a green door guarding the exit, with [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|super missiles being the key]] to unlock. Ambient zeelas will also [[../reference#Easter Eggs|fall from the ceiling]] upon the explosive impact of the super missile. The enemies brought forth by the generator can [[../reference#Farming Mobs|replenish any wasted super missiles]] needed to progress past this room as well as the [[#Big Pink|next]].

==== Green Hill Zone ====
* This room features a stair-step like pattern with several "floors" going downward. Several pipes spawning geegas also occupy the room. Upon entering through the main entrance, a foothold can be seen, but is [[../reference#|too high to reach]] merely by jumping.
* At the end of the room lies a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|blue shutter door]], opening and closing when shot with any regular weapons fire- but only from the side the button is facing. Though not obvious to the player, they are actually being [[../reference#One-way Valves|locked from backtracking at all]] should they feel like it, by the shutter.
* After returning with the power bomb and hi-jump boots, the high foothold across from the main entrance can be mounted, and the yellow door occupying it can be accessed if they hadn't already come out from the [[#Morph Ball Room|other side]] by now.

==== Noob Bridge ====
* A long horizontal stretch of platform occupies the room, splitting it into two halves on the top and bottom. Taking the bottom route leads to a complete dead end, as nothing the player can do can bypass the pillar connecting the platform with the floor, so the only way to cross is the top half. The floor on the top half will disintegrate upon being stepped on, forcing a walking player to fall through and start over.
* Spikes line the top of the ceiling above the disintegrating floor, [[../reference#Deterrence|deincentivizing the player to try jumping]] across the fragile blocks, as it isn't the intended solution. Unless the player has learned by now that they can run by holding B, they will [[../reference#Skill Check|need to learn here in order to progress]]. Furthermore, the shutter in the [[#Green Hill Zone|previous room]] will prevent the player from going any further back to ensure the player that they do have the means necessary to cross the bridge.

==== Red Tower ====
[[file:BigPink.png|{IMG}]]
* Upon entering the tower, a foothold can be seen above by jumping, but is [[../reference#Teasers|too high to reach]], forcing the player to descend.
* After descending downward, the player comes across a cubby blocked off by blocks and walls, with a yellow door being visible on the west side. Attempting to bomb the block on the side of the door will only reveal more of the [[../reference#Teasers|same type of weapon block]] seen before in the [[#Green Brinstar Main Shaft|green shaft]] and [[#Big Pink|big pink]] that are currently indestructible. By this point, the player should be trained to try using brute force to find the hidden tunnel directly beneath, but box on the right can also be bombed to reveal a beetom from within. In a panic, the player is inclined to try spamming morph ball bombs to kill it since nothing else will, and in doing so can also reveal the same hidden tunnel beneath, leading not to the yellow door but descending further down the tower.
* After descending further, the player will be [[../reference#One-way Valves|locked from within again]], as they will fall for a good while down the shaft full of back-and-forth roaming rippers, although an [[energy refill station]] and the door to progression are found at opposing sides at the bottom. If at any point in time from here the player returns, they will not be able to go back up the tower until they've acquired the ice beam.
* After finally acquiring the ice beam, the player can trek their way back up the tower by [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|freezing the rippers and using them as platforms to escape]]. The energy refill station is particularly useful here to recuperate from damage the player may take from being struck by the unfrozen rippers should they fail the platforming exercise back up the tower.
* Once the player makes it back up from the bottom, they still cannot go back through the shutter door in [[#Green Hill Zone|green brinstar]], but the foothold seen upon first entering the tower can be accessed with the hi-jump boots to reveal another ripper platforming section above. The outlined blocks must be shot open atop the final frozen ripper to access the very top of the tower and the door [[#Hellway|forward]].

==== Bat Room ====
[[file:BatRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* The west half of the room from the main entrance consists of two footholds on either side divided by a relatively shallow pool of water. In order to successfully cross, the player can either perform a running jump, or a well-timed regular jump to reach the centerpiece leading the the east half of the room.
* There, another centerpiece can be seen between two more pools of with spikes, as well as two idling on the ceiling just above it. From previous encounters with similar enemies, [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|the player can infer]] that they will dive-bomb the player as soon as the centerpiece is approached. The player can dispatch them prematurely before giving them that chance.
* The spikes between the sides of the second centerpiece are especially dangerous since because they are underwater, they will take longer to escape from as the player's movement will be hindered. The energy refill station in the [[#Red Tower|previous room]] can be useful to players low on health after the ordeal, as they can heal damage taken from the spikes and try the room again.

==== Below Spazer ====
[[file:BelowSpazer.png|{IMG}]]
* Immediately upon entering, the yapping maw guarding the small platforms needed to cross the pool of water catches the player's eye. Before challenging it though, the player is inclined to dispatch the cacatac shooting projectiles at the far end of the room. The player must perform a [[../reference#Skill Check|swift platforming exercise]] to avoid being grabbed by the disturbed yapping maw to proceed to the centerpiece, and once more to proceed [[#Glass Tunnel|forward]].
* A hole in the ceiling with a foothold can be seen and accessed above the centerpiece, revealing what appears to be a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|room above the ceiling]], but [[../reference#Reacharound|no way of accessing it from there]]. A [[../reference#Visual Hinting|single suspicious block]] can be easily missed just above the room's entrance, but the foothold above it is [[../reference#Teasers|too high to be reached]] at the moment.
* After having acquired the hi-jump boots [[#Hi Jump Boots Room|somewhat locally]], the player can return and reach the foothold the block covers over and discover the tunnel leading to the mysterious room with the green door occupying the ceiling. If the player is not holding right while bombing the second block in the tunnel, they will fall through the [[hidden destructible block underneath]], dropping them nearby the yapping maw below and forcing them to retrace their steps. With all of the blockage having been cleared however, they have no reason to fail again and can simply [[../reference#Streamlining|breeze through]] and grab the spazer beam past the green door.
* During the backtrack after stage 2 Norfair, the yapping maws are [[../reference#Streamlining|easily and satisfyingly dealt with]] using the newly-acquired ice beam as they are rendered harmless and simply be walked across.

==== Warehouse Entrance ====
* Upon first entering, the player is highly inclined to take the elevator down to continue progression, but an attentive player may [[../reference#Visual Hinting|notice the map]] hinting at more that what meets the eye, as it shows an extension to the right of the room. The [[../reference#Symbolic Hinting|super missile blocks]] reveal themselves upon being bombed, and the player can access the extension after destroying one, revealing room with a [[../reference#Teasers|foothold barely too high to reach]] with the [[../reference#Landmarking|husk of a monster's face]] looming over the entryway.
* Using the newly-acquired hi-jump boots, the player can return and reach the foothold from before and continue, if they hadn't already discovered it.

==== Warehouse Zeela Room ====
* Marking the beginning of stage 3 of Brinstar, the player is brought into a cramped room crawling with zeelas and a girder bridge above a space containing a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|rogue zeela]], as well as the map showing space below. Inclined to shoot or bomb their way under the girder, the player can indeed do so through a small opening and descend further into an area with a [[locked door]].
* Although the map shows an extension only directly east of the girder bridge, no destructible blocks are available to use up there. The player being inclined to bomb below the bridge opposite to the locked door will reveal a secret morph ball tunnel on the right with a vertical door leading forward, establishing that the [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|correct path may not necessarily exist on the map]].
* During the backtrack after defeating Kraid and acquiring the varia suit, the once unlocked door becomes [[#Warehouse Energy Tank Room|unlocked]].

==== Warehouse Kihunter Room ====
* After deling with a swarm of kihunters patrolling the room, a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|depression in the floor]] can be seen at the far east end, and bombing it will unlock a tunnel leading to the nearby save room.
* Although the map shows an [[../reference#Visual Hinting|extention below the room]], the solution once again isn't as straightforward as following the map. Bombing or shooting the [[../reference#Visual hinting|suspicious crack in the floor plating]] in the center of the room will reveal another secret tunnel leading to the path forward.

==== Baby Kraid Room ====
* Several green space pirates as well as a baby kraid patrol the long hallway, and must be defeated to unlock the doors and proceed. The space pirates are straightforward (especially with the spazer beam) but the baby kraid will send a barrage of [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|projectiles of varying heights]] to avoid well before it's in view. The spikes hanging from the ceiling will also punish players for [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|jumping too high]] over the baby kraid's projectiles

==== Kraid Eye Door Room ====
* Upon entering, an open space behind the ceiling above the door can be seen an broken into by shooting the ceiling open to reveal a green door containing an energy refill station next to a missile refill station, conveniently placed before and after the boss. However, a gamet generator can also be used to slowly farm health/ammo.
* A [[../reference#Easter Eggs|dead soldier]] can be found lying on the ground before the first encounter with a gedora, a bio-organic door shield that [[../reference#Peakaboo Weakspot|periodically exposes its eye]], taking three missiles (or one super) to dispatch. The projectiles they shoot after exposing the eye for too long inflict minor damage, but also absorb missile fire. After dispatching the gedora, the [[#Kraid|boss]] room becomes accessible, and the varia suit is unlocked after emerging victorious, bringing Brinstar's third stage to a close.

==== Warehouse Energy Tank Room ====
* The small room is infested with beetoms, and they will attack immediately upon entering as entrance locks until they are all dispatched. After doing so, the player may be inclined to explore the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|suspicious cracks in the plating]] around, but only one in the ceiling contains an energy tank upgrade.

==== Hellway ====
* Entering from the main entrance at the top of the [[#Red Tower|tower]], The player is met with a hallway filled with hazards like spikes lining the ceiling floor, samus eaters that catch the player at the bottom and deal gradual damage before letting go, and zebbos gradually being spawn from the ground to deal damage upon contact.

==== Caterpillar Room ====
* Immediately upon entering, the main entrance door behind the player [[../reference#One-way Valves|locks them in as a yellow door]]. Ascending up the room, a [[save station]] can be found as well as a [[#Beta Power Bomb Room|green door]] and an elevator heading upward. The save station is conveniently placed so that the player is inclined to save first before finding the dangerous room beyond the green door, and to ensure that the player eventually finds the [[#Alpha Power Bomb Room|power bomb room]] hidden nearby, as the room directly proceeding the elevator is also blocked by a [[../reference#Teasers|yellow door]].
* By noticing the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|suspicious outlined blocks]] just outside the main entrance, the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|pipe outside the wall]] heading down, or just by sheer [[../reference#Conditioning|brute force]] due to being totally locked in, The player should inevitably discover the secret underground passage leading to the [[../reference#Alpha Power Bomb Room|power bomb room]].
* Should the player waste all of their power bombs and not opening any yellow doors for some reason, they are insured by the zeros roaming the secret underground entrance, as unlike the cacatacs also within the room, they are [[../reference#Farming Mobs|certain to drop power bomb replenishments]] when dispatched.

==== Beta Power Bomb Room ====
* Immediately upon entry, large sidehoppers dealing big damage can be seen aggressively approaching, but with [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|quick evasive reactions]], the morph ball can slide right under them without being touched. While standard weapons fire will work, missiles do the job much more safely and efficiently. However, after dispatching the sidehoppers, nothing in the room appears to be of use besides the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|gunmetal bridge]]. Upon bombing it though, reveals that it is made up of [[../reference#Symbolic Hinting|power bomb blocks]], and unless the player has aquired it, they will be [[../reference#Teasers|forced to retreat]].
* Upon having acuired the power bombs, the player can return and dispatch the sidehoppers to deal with the bridge by destroying it with the newly-acquired power bomb. The only thing under the bridge that seems slightly out of place is the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|single samus eater out of the three]] without a yapping-maw inside. With no other option and a leap of faith, the player can jump through and enter a hidden cubby containing a power bomb expansion.

==== Alpha Power Bomb Room ====
* A group of boyons hover above the spikes and samus eaters in the room, and ought to be frozen in place to walk over them and avoid taking damage. The power bombs lie in a chozo statues hands, and should the player feel [[../reference#Novelty Option|curious]] or zealous enough to [[../reference#Taste Testing|immediately use one]], the wall beyond the statue will break open to reveal a missile expansion.

==== Brinstar Reserve Tank Room ====
* A chozo statue at the end of the chamber holds a reserve tank powerup, but if the player opts to [[../reference#Novelty Option|morph through the pipe under the statue]] however, they will discover a secret chamber hidden behind the wall containing a missile expansion. Should the player be so zealous as to [[../reference#Novelty Option|bomb the wall directly adjacent]] to the missiles, they will discover a [[hidden secret within the hidden secret]] containing yet another missile expansion.

==== Green Brinstar Beetom Room ====
* Several agitated beetoms will attack the player once entered, but with a variety of new weapons suited to deal with them such as the ice beam and power bombs, they can be made quick work of.

==== Etecoon Energy Tank Room ====
* A narrow hallway contains an energy tank that can be seen at the end, but just before it lies an invisisble trap door ready to send the player down into the gutter, where they will find a save room, but also a trial of spikes, beetoms, and zebbo spawners as they carefully perform a tight platform exercise towards the [[#Etecoon Room|gutter's exit]].
* Several methods can be used to bypass the invisible trap door.

==== Etecoon Room ====
* Three etecoons [[../reference#Easter Eggs|sing the fanfare jingle]] together immediately upon entering, making their presence known. The room consists of a tall shaft with small ledges that can't be mounted even with the hi-jump boots. The etecoons [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|work their way up the sides of the wall in a way that looks vaguely applicable]] to the player. With absolutely no other way to escape, the player can copy their movements to learn how to perform the walljump. An somewhat advanced technique, the player [[../reference#Skill Check|needs only to perform a single one]] to successfully reach the first foothold leading to the escape tunnel back to the bottom half of the [[#Green Brinstar Main Shaft|main shaft]] to either attempt to grab the [[#Etecoon Energy Tank Room|energy tank]] again, or retreat and head back up.
* Should the player keep trying to walljump [[../reference#Road Less Traveled|further up the shaft]], a secondary foothold to the side after the first one can be used as another checkpoint should they make a mistake. The final stretch requires [[several consecutive walljumps]] to reach the top of the shaft where the player can [[#Green Brinstar Main Shaft|leave through the locked door]] seen in the shaft, but also find a [[../reference#Teaser|tunnel within the wall]] opposite to the goal as an [[../reference#Visual Hinting|etecoon points out as well]] by leaping into it. Should the player risk falling back down, a swift and successful midair morph into the tunnel following the etecoon will reveal a chamber with a power bomb expansion inside. Coming back out of the chamber however, will still set them back at the second checkpoint.

----

=== NORFAIR ===
* Stage 1 of Norfair is somewhat short-lived, but serves its purpose in both providing the player the hi-jump boots necessary to backtrack toward the [[#Warehouse Entrance|warehouse]] and [[#Below Spazer|other room]] seen before, and also establishing several new areas the player is [[../reference#Systematic Gatekeeping|gatekept from]] within a relatively short amount of time.
* Norfair stage 2 begins after the player defeats Kraid and returns with the varia suit to explore the depths that were too hot before. In doing so, they will eventually find the... Fitting with the fiery theme is the [[../reference#Floor is Lava|lava that fills many of the floors]] within Norfair's hot sections.

==== Business Center ====
* Upon riding the elevator down for the first time, the player gets their first impression of Norfair in tall shaft-structured room similarly seen before in [[#Green Brinstar Main Shaft|brinstar]]. Besides the [[../reference#Teaser|yellow door]] in the middle-left of the room, the player has the means to access all of the doors in the shaft.
* The bottom of the shaft lined with a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|thin layer of blocks with an open space and an sova behind it]] can be opened up to reveal another door.

==== Ice Beam Gate Room ====
[[file:IceBeamGateRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* Coming from the green door seen in the business center, a walking player will be quickly stopped by a proximity shutter preventing further access into the hall. Although a running start would also work, an [[../reference#Visual Hinting|open space within a tunnel]] can be seen below the floor, and bombs will allow the player to bypass the gate from below, but a second [[../reference#Teasers|faster gate blocks any form of progression]], as it cannot be sped past or bombed under/over at this time, forcing the player to retreat.
* A sova can also be seen crawling along the tunnel in the ceiling, most likely [[../reference#Visual Hinging|subtly implying]] that the tunnel below mentioned before can also be crawled along.
* After returning with the speed booster, the player has the speed necessary to be able to get a run under the far gate and explore. However, as the running start necessary to get under it is nowhere on the other side of the gate, the player is [[#One-way Valves|locked within]].
* A cluster of [[../reference#Symbolic Hinting|power bomb blocks]] restricts access to a lower section of the room found past the second gate, but [[../reference#Teasers|nothing can be done with them]] the first time coming.
* After acquiring the ice beam and completing the [[#Ice Beam Tutorial Room|tutorial room]], the player drops from the ceiling above until eventually falling into the ceiling where the tunnel above the gates can be bombed through and accessed, leading the player back to the main entrance thereby finishing stage 2 of Norfair.

==== Cathedral Entrance ====
* Immediately entering during stage 1, the player is [[../reference#Deterrence|contemporarily blocked off]] in all immediate directions preventing them from committing to exploring the room as they are [[../reference#Tick Damage|gradually being cooked alive]] by the intense heat, forcing them back to [[../reference#Teasers|explore later]].
* After returning with the varia suit, the player can safely enter and bomb the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|narrow foothold below them]] to [[#Cathedral|continue forth]] and explore.

==== Frog Speedway ====
[[file:FrogSpeedwaySmile.png|{IMG}]]
* East-adjacent to the save room to the right of the shaft, frog speedway consists of a long, narrow hallway filled with blockage and crawling with beetoms. However, bombing the rubble will reveal a [[../reference#Symbolic Hinting|distinct speed booster block]], forcing the player to [[../reference#Teasers|retreat until acquired]].
* Upon entering [[#Upper Norfair Farming Room|from the east side]], the familiar room is revisited, but unless the player has obtained the speed booster, the player will [[../reference#Teasers|again be blocked]] by the [[../reference#Symbolic Hinting|booster blocks]] and can only put together that the room serves as a [[../reference#Streamlining|shortcut back and forth]] through the [[#Business Center|business center]].

==== Hi Jump Energy Tank Room ====
[[file:HiJumpEnergyTankRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* From the bottom-west door from the shaft, the player is rewarded with an energy tank as the [[../reference#One-way Valves|door behind locks]], but a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|sova scurrying within a tunnel]] in the corner of the room can also be seen below the bridge the player stands upon. Inclined to follow it, two blocks can be disintegrated upon contact allowing the player access to the rest of the room. As the player descends, the player has [[no way of escaping once]] they've committed, as they cannot jump high enough to reach the foothold directly above to leave, forcing them into the adjacent door to obtain the next upgrade.
* After just acquiring the hi-jump boots, the player can reach the foothold to escape and grab a missile expansion on their way out of the room.

==== Hi Jump Boots Room ====
[[file:HiJumpBootsRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* A Chozo statue can immediately be seen behind the dividing wall, and upon shooting the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|suspicious plating]] near the top of the wall, access becomes granted. Using the newly-acquired hi-jump boots, the player can jump back over the wall from the trough letting them escape.

==== Crocomire Escape ====
* Entering from below the destructible bridge within the business center, a missile expansion on the ground can be seen behind a shutter door. However, even if the player has acquired the varia suit to be able to even widthstand the intense heat, the shutter cannot be bypassed as the green button is on the [[../reference#Reacharound|other side]].

==== Cathedral ====
[[file:Cathedral.png|{IMG}]]
%% Enemy can get itself positioned in a way where the player can accidentally shoot a block under the lava, uncovering a missile from within

==== Rising Tide ====
* Upon entering, the ground will begin to shake, and the [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|lava from below will begin to rise from the ground]] and subside after some time. The player must consecutively jump along several narrow pillars and platforms to avoid/dispatch the scurrying sovas and also falling in the lava. Several squeepts leap straight up from the lava at randomly varying heights. They cannot practically be killed, so [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|they should be respected]]. As the player continues Dragons will eventually emerge from the lava and launch projectiles in an arc pattern that can be [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|avoided by crouching or morphing upon the pillars]]. The dragons cannot be killed easily with normal weapon fire, but three missiles will do the job.

==== Bubble Mountain ====
[[file:BubbleMountain.png|{IMG}]]
* Bubble mountain is a large, tall room made up of [[../reference#Micro-areas|several parts]] split horizontally into two halves- one full of green bubbles and the other full of metal pipes and blocks. As the name implies, the room is also distinct in that it's filled with [[../reference#Landmarking|bright green bubbles]].
* The somewhat [[../reference#Visual Hinting|conspicuous metal pipe with a sova crawling under it]] just outside the main entrance can be bombed, but only to reveal the [[../reference#Symbolic Hinting|power bomb blocks]] it's made up of.
* A save room can be found in the middle-west adjacent room, but two high footholds- one further right and one directly above- [[../reference#Teasers|cannot be reached]] even with hi-jump boots.
* At the far-east end of the room, the player can bomb the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|small pieces of pipe]] that descend in a staggered pattern to an underground cubby containing a missile expansion. From there and even while bombing, [[../reference#Visual Hinting|sovas can be seen scurrying inside a tunnel]] within the wall just outside of the cubby.
* In the very center of the room sits a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|suspicious altar containing a thin layer of blocks]]. Bombing them allows access below, and into series of tunnels within the wall occupied by sovas. The sovas occupying the tunnel can be dispatched with weapon fire or well-placed bombs as they approach. At the end of the tunnel, the player is confronted with two more rooms leading [[#Upper Norfair Farming Room|west]] and [[down]], as well as a foothold leading to the metal pipe below the main entrance, [[../reference#Visual Hinting|serving as implications]].
* At the end of the Norfair circuit, the player is spit back out within the upper-east foothold of the room. From there, they can climb and find two paths. The left path contains square blocks lining the ceiling seen [[#Double Chamber|before]], but with nothing to use on them the player would be [[../reference#Deterrence|jumping into a pit]] leading them back to the bottom of the room where they will have to redo the roundabout again. Inclined not to do so, the player can enter the room directly accessible to the [[#Bat Cave|right]].
%% Ice beam thing...

==== Upper Norfair Farming Room ====
[[file:UpperNorfairFarmingRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* From the main entrance, the player can simply move [[#Frog Speedway|straight forward]] over the drop and across the room, or descend downward and shoot/bomb through the thin bridge to find a gamet spawner that spawns the [[../reference#|dispersing gamets]] useful for farming, [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|a fire-spitting fune]], as well as a shutter with the blue button on the other side. With [[../reference#Teasers|seemingly no way of opening it]], the player must retreat back.

==== Purple Shaft ====
[[file:Purple_Shaft.png|{IMG}]]
* A very basic shaft with nothing in it besides two east exits [[#Purple Farming Room|high]] and [[#Magdolite Tunnel|low]], the player descends primarily to set up space for the beginning of the Norfair circuit.

==== Purple Farming Room ====
[[file:PurpleFarmingRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* A single [[../reference#Generator|gamet spawner]] sits in the center of the small room and [[../reference#Farming Mobs|serves it's purpose]] as the room's name implies.

==== Magdollite Tunnel ====
[[file:MagdolliteTunnel.png|{IMG}]]
* Magdollites and surface-bouncing multiviolas occupy the room of [[../reference#Floor is Lava|lava and platforming]]. The multiviolas can be dispatched with weapons fire, but magdollites will emerge from the lava when disturbed by proximity. Although their projectile attacks can be negated with weapons fire, they can also be [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|dodged with morph ball evasions]].

==== Kronic Boost Room ====
[[file:KronicBoostRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* The intended path forward lies just across from the main exit, but if the player chooses to descend down the room, they will be met with a [[../reference#Teasers|yellow door]] that they can only access later.
* An attentive player may notice the somewhat [[../reference#Visual Hinting|suspicious depression]] over the wall protrusion implies a secret tunnel may be there, and while it is indeed the case, the player is met with a [[../reference#Teasers|one-way shutter door]] that impedes any progression.

==== Volcano Room ====
[[file:VolcanoRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* As the ground starts to shake, the room starts to [[../reference#Floor is Lava|slowly fill with lava]] again, but with [[../reference#Timed Escape Sequence|no sign of stopping]]. At the end of the hall lies a tunnel below a fune leading into a small chamber. In a panic, the player is inclined to shoot the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|thin block bridge]] directly above to escape the chamber and quickly climb up the staggered ascent of [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|fire-spitting funes]] to proceed to the exit at the top.

==== Spiky Platforms Tunnel ====
[[file:SpikyPlatformsTunnel.png|{IMG}]]
* A [[../reference#Floor is Lava|pit full of lava]] and spiky pillars can be seen upon entering, as well as a tripper flying across back and forth with a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|distinctly flat head]]. Inclined to jump upon and ride the tripper as a moving platform, the player must [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|duck and morph under the spikes]] to avoid damage and reach the center of the trial to perform a platforming exercise across [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|narrow pillars and spikes]] while [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|timing a broken shutter door]] that acts as a barrier that opens and closes at set intervals. Afterwards, another tripper offers a ride to the end of the room, but while repeating the same procedure as before the player must hop off at the end, as the tripper descends slowly nearing the lava.

==== Single Chamber ====
[[file:BubbleShaft.png|{IMG}]]
* The staggered ascent of the room is filled with alcoons and multiviolas, but two doors on the [[right]] can be accessed before leaving through the door [[#Bubble Mountain|above]] towards progression.

==== Double Chamber ====
[[file:DoubleChamber.png|{IMG}]]
* As the name implies, the large open room consists of [[../reference#Micro-Areas|two distinct split sectors]]. The first part contains the main entrances containing a platforming section and a shutter gate to open. Proceeding that is a large spike pit with a door atop a foothold on the other side, and a [[gutter]] at the very bottom of the room.
* Entering from the bottom entrance leads the player to the gutter, where [[../reference#Teasers|platforms above can be seen]], but are too high to reach. A tunnel splitting the bottom from the other half of the room reveals a hallway below the spike pit and a staggered ascent up just enough tiny platforms to where the player can [[../reference#Teasers|see the door above]], but is inaccessible from the bottom. The only way to reach it is to start by heading [[#Single Chamber|back]] and entering from the door above.
* From the high entrance, the player can begin the trial by successfully platforming upon the glowing [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|proximity platforms]] that rise and fall when approached. The player will fall back into the gutter if they fail the platforming or get knocked off by the [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|fireballs spit by the funes]] on either side. The shutter door at the end must be opened to allow access to the missile expansion as well as the second part of the trial.
* The second trial contains the spike pit section. The door on the other side cannot be reached by merely jumping. The ceiling blocks on the wall are [[../reference#Visual Hinting|distinct enough to appear significant]], but [[../reference#Teasers|nothing the player currently has can make use of them]]. Attempts to jump across will fall short, sending them into the spike pit where- in a panic- the player will eventually fall through the spikes above the thin layer of blocks sending them back into the gutter. A [[../reference#Generator|kago]] within the gutter serves as a good means to [[../reference#Farming Mobs|replenish from the ordeal]].

==== Bat Cave ====
[[file:BatCave.png|{IMG}]]
* Upon first entering, skrees can be seen occupying the ceiling in an otherwise [[../reference#Visual Hinting|suspiciously desolate room]]. Inclined to shoot them, the player is likely to shoot open a hole in the ceiling leading upward to a [[../reference#Replenishment Mobs|gamet]] [[../reference#Generator|spawner]] and the next room.

==== Speed Booster Hall ====
[[file:SpeedBoosterHall.png|{IMG}]]
* A long hallway filled with enemies and [[../reference#Callback|collapsing bridges seen before]] occupies the room. The first bridge merely [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|shows how they collapse]] as the individual blocks disintegrate upon standing on them, and so the player is then inclined to prevent having to jump across the fragile blocks again and simply run past the bridges.
* Immediately after coming back after acquiring the speed booster, the ground continues to shake and rise the lava, forcing the player to [[../reference#Basic Mechanical Tutorial|run back with the newly acquired speed booster]]. The spikes lining the top of the room closest to the main exit [[../reference#Deterrence|deter the player from jumping]] which would cause them to lose momentum from the speed booster and likely die from the lava as a result.

==== Speed Booster Room ====
[[file:SpeedBoosterRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* Immediately after acquiring the speed booster upgrade, the [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|ground begins shaking]] and [[../reference#Visual Hinting|lava begins rising]] from the ground, forcing the player to leave.

==== Ice Beam Acid Room ====
[[file:IceBeamAcidRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* Three small [[../reference#Floor is Lava|pits of lava]] hovered over by trippers occupy the room. However, standing on the trippers for too long [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|causes them to sink]] closer to the lava, and can cause damage.

==== Ice Beam Snake Room ====
[[file:IceBeamSnakeRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* Upon entering, the player is inclined to work their way up the staggered ascent of the main path, respecting the [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|funes and their projectiles]] along the way, but a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|pack of sovas can be seen]] crawling out of a tall, narrow crawlspace on the east side of the room.
* At the top of the room just below the door, a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|depression in the ground]] can be seen with an [[../reference#Visual Hinting|open space below]], Shooting/bombing it will break it open to allow access to the crawlspace, leading to the room holding the ice beam.
* Immediately after obtaining the ice beam, the sovas can be [[../reference#Mechanical Tutorial|shot and frozen in place]], even making them effective platforms. On the way back up the snake, the [[../reference#Mechanical Tutorial|funes can also be frozen]] in place, rendering them [[../reference#Incapacitation|temporarily harmless]] and [[../reference#Streamlining|streamlining the ascent]].

==== Ice Beam Tutorial Room ====
* Upon entering, a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|ball tunnel can be seen]] at the far end of the room behind a large pit of lava filled with boyons that leap when agitated by proximity. With no clear direction on what to do here, the player is inclined to leave and come back once having acquired the ice beam.
* After returning with the ice beam and immediately getting to see how it works, the player must begin their escape past the [[#Ice Beam Gate Room|gate room]] here by [[../reference#Mechanical Tutorial|freezing the boyons consecutively]] to reach the ball tunnel, and also [[../reference#Mechanical Tutorial|freezing the ripper]] to safely cross the second pit of lava before exiting.

== BOSSES ==

=== Ridley I ===
* This is a [[stage fight]] primarily set to establish Ridley's control over the infant metroid's tank. Ridley's primary attacks consist of swooping, tail swiping, and fireballs. These attacks are executed in an RNG cycle. Since Ridley's body does the most damage, one possible strategy is to try and get hit by the tail to minimize damage taken. The tail will occasionally spin and strike toward the player. The fireball attack is a volley projectile that [[../reference#Area of Effect|spreads out]] when hitting the floor or wall. This is a good opportunity to shoot him. Once the player's health drops below a certain point, he will fly away and the fight will end, but if the player manages to shoot him enough, he will [[../reference#Easter Eggs|briefly folly about]], temporarily dropping the tank and flying away, ending the fight.

=== Torizo ===

=== Spore Spawn ===
* Upon the [[../reference#One-way Valves|vertical door locking]] when entering, spores will begin falling from the ceiling, and deal minimal damage when touched. The boss reveals itself as a large round object oscillating in a figure-eight pattern, dealing damage upon contact. The fight involves the player avoiding contact with both the boss and its [[../reference#Bullet Rain|continuous rain of spores]] and quickly repositioning to shoot the [[../reference#Peakaboo Weakspot|temporarily exposed internals]] from the side platforms, as they are [[../reference#Shrouded Weakspot|covered from the bottom]]. As the fight progresses, the boss will speed up oscillation after crossing a health threshold. The morph ball is a very good tool to avoid contact from the boss as it cannot reach, but the spores can still hit you. The spores can be dispatched with weapon fire to [[../reference#Farming Mobs|refill health/ammo]] during the fight, but the player must briefly exit the safety of the morph ball in order to shoot. If spores are in the wrong place at the wrong time when the boss opens up, they can knock the player off balance and ruin a chance to strike. With careful positioning, shooting, and precalculation in relation to where spores are located, the player can find and create the optimal time and place to strike the boss. Depending on how good the players is, they can shoot up to 2 or even 3 missiles in one strike.
* Another strategy is to not grab the item drops from the dispatched spores and keep them airborne for as long as possible to prevent or "back-up" more spores from spawning.
* It can be noted that the charge beam does double the normal amount of damage against the boss, but considering how long it takes to prepare, and the fact that you can only shoot 1 charge shot, it isn't as effective as rapid missile fire.
* Once defeated, the dried corpse of the boss can be climbed upon to escape the room from the top end to [[#Spore Spawn Super Room|progress further]].
