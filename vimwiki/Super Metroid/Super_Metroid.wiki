----

== GENERAL/OVERVIEW ==
* Bosses gruadually [[../reference#Visual Hinting|shift color hues]] to reflect their health status.
* A 2-Dimensional map in the top right of the status HUD shows the player's position in relation to the world around them, as well as automatically graphs out as the player explores areas they've never been.
* Points of interest are [[../reference#Visual Hinting|noted with a dot]] (.) in the middle of the square representing the general area. These points of interest typically include powerups, but can also include health/ammo stations, and boss rooms. Elevators are marked with a dash (-) symbol. The player's last known save point is highlighted with a special 'S' icon, distinct from the other save rooms.
* Doors that have been locked upon entry, but unlocked after completing a local task (typically killing enemies) will [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|flash to reflect their status]].
* Shutters act as [[../reference#One-way Valves|one-way gates]], as they can only be opened from one side. The color-coded buttons correspond with basic doors to reflect the weapon requirements needed for activation. These shutters automatically close when the player leaves the room and returns.
* Doors typically lock themselves until all [[enemies within a given room are defeated]].
* Hi-jump boots expand the player's standard maximum jump height, allowing for reaching higher footholds as well as [[../reference#Streamline Ability|faster vertical traversal]].
* Spazer beam greatly expands the width of the standard beam fire, making killing small/agile enemies much easier, as well as a considerable increase in firepower.
%% Save station entries geometrically streamlined...
%% Power bombs can quickly clear lots of bombable blocks caught within its radius...
%% Techniques like wall jumps, mach ball, shinespark etc retroactively change the game...

== AREAS ==
[[file:metroid3_map.gif|{IMG}]]

=== CERES STATION ===
* This temporary macro-area serves as a very [[../reference#Basic Mechanical Tutorial|short and basic tutorial section]] helping the player to get accustomed to the controls and establish the plot.
* After surviving the first encounter with [[#Ridley I|Ridley]],

==== Ridley's Room ====
* Upon meeting the captive metroid in the middle of the room, [[#Ridley I|Ridley]] emerges from the darkness in the background to engage the player in a battle.

----

=== CRATERIA ===
%% Stage 1 involves crawling down the deserted cavern and entering Brinstar...
%% Stage 2 involves exploring Parlor and Alcatraz and its adjacent rooms with the newly acquired morph ball and missile launcher from stage 1 Brinstar...
%% Map room right across from the final missile bombway to hint the player where to go...

==== Landing Site ====
* Upon landing, the player is confronted with the east and west directions to begin exploration. On the east side, a [[../reference#Teasers|high-above foothold]] can be seen, but is too high to reach. A suspicious [[../reference#Teasers|rock blockage]] also fills a tunnel, but nothing can be done at this time. The cave on the west side holds the door to progression.
* Immediately after having acquired the bombs, the blockage can easily be investigated and successfully cleared with bombs, but the player will quickly meet another dead-end, as a [[../reference#Teasers|green door]] halts their progress shortly after the tunnel, and with no tools to deal with it the player must retreat.

==== Parlor and Alcatraz ====
* The player is met with several [[../reference#Teasers|inaccessible tunnelways]] while they enter the room and as descend down the platforms of the cavern. Ambient bugs also [[../reference#PRESENTATION|scatter away]] in the background when disturbed during the first stage. A door [[../reference#Teasers|sealed behind a small tunnel]] can be seen while descending, as well as two opposite doors below that: one blue and one red. However, the [[../reference#Teasers|red door is currently inaccessible]], and while the room behind the blue door is, nothing useful can be done [[#Final Missile Bombway|there]] at this point. The only way clear way forward is the blue door heading [[#Climb|downward]].
* The once deserted cavern is now occupied with geemers crawling along the walls and platforms. The player is inclined to [[../reference#Basic Mechanical Tutorial|exercise their shooting abilities]], making use of the up, down, and diagonal shots to dispatch them. The first two rooms on the [[#Pre-Map Flyway|east]] and [[#Final Missile Bombway|west]] upon coming back up can now be expored further with the morph ball and missile launcher. The door clearly behind the tunnel seen before can also be accessed, revealing a save station.
* After going far enough back up, one of the tunnelways seen upon immediately entering in stage 1 can be accessed, leading underground and locking the player within "Alcatraz", until they have acquired bombs going [[#Flyway|forward]].
* After having acquired bombs, the player returns with the means to be able to escape Alcatraz through the ball tunnel leading out by bombing the rubble blocking passage, leading back to the very entrance of the room. The [[../reference#Visual Hinting|suspicious looking rocks]] at the end of the top hallway hint that there may be more than what meets the eye, as well as the map indications showing that there is something behind there. Indeed, the plot thickens once the player bombs away at the rocks, revealing the [[#Terminator Room|progression forward]].

==== Final Missile Bombway ====
* Upon entering in stage 1 Crateria, the player's options are highly limited, as they are immediately gatekept by a [[../reference#Teasers|small tunnel]], which cannot be entered until the morph ball is obtained.
* After completing Brinstar stage 2 and acquiring the morph ball and missile launcher, the player can re-enter the room and access the tunnel, but they are quickly stopped short by [[../reference#Teasers|blockage filling the tunnel]], and will have to retreat unless they've acquired bombs to [[#The Final Missile|reach the end]].
* After coming back through from grabbing the so called "[[#The Final Missile|final missile]]", the player may be inclined to simply hold right as they bomb their way back through the tunnel, but in doing so will discover a hidden invisible tunnel within the wall, allowing [[../reference#Streamlining|quick and easy access]] over the rubble and plopping them back near the entrance door.

==== Climb ====
* A very long series of platforms of various sizes are laid across the entirety of the tall, narrow room. The first time entering, the player can slowly descend upon the platforms, but keeping to the side [[../reference#Streamlining|speeds things up]] as there is a long stretch of open space.
* Space pirates infest the room upon returning from the [[#Pit Room|pit room]]. The player must climb their way up the [[../reference#Basic Mechanical Tutorial|long series of small platforms]], with space pirates climbing on the walls and firing projectiles.

==== Pit Room ====
* This room contains a consecutive series of platforms and pillars for the player to [[../reference#Basic Mechanical Tutorial|exercise their platforming consistency]] on. Upon the player's first arrival here, the [[../reference#One-way Valves|entrance locks itself]], sealing the player within. An elevator leading down to [[#BRINSTAR|Brinstar]] awaits the player at the far east end.
* Upon returning after acquiring both the morph ball and missile launcher, the lights turn on, and space pirates have [[../reference#Backtrack Filler|infested the room]]. They are relatively weak, and take only one shot to dispatch. They occupy the platforms needed to cross the room, and sometimes climb on walls. After [[defeating all of them]], the doors in the room will unlock, allowing the player to continue backtracking.

==== Pre-Map Flyway ====
* Several mellows and a reo occupy the hallway. While the mellows are merely basic fly enemies, the reo takes multiple hits to kill and will bounce along the ceiling, making it a more challenging foe, although a single missile shot will make instant work of it.
* The Crateria [[map room]] is just behind the door at the end of the hallway. With it, the player can find rooms they haven't explored (marked in blue), and get an idea of where they need to go next.

==== Flyway ====
* A large [[../reference#Cluster Enemies|swarm of mellows]] occupy the hallway leading to a red door, where five missiles must be spent to access it. The mellows can merely be run past swiftly to avoid combat altogether, but their numbers can [[../reference#Farming Mobs|drop the missiles necessary]] both to open the door, and replenish health/ammo when coming out if need be. A meticulous player may even opt to [[../reference#Novelty Option|open the door first]], and then fight the flies to replenish the health/missiles used. Doing so may prove useful within the [[#Bomb Torizo Room|proceeding room]].

==== Bomb Torizo Room ====
* Upon entering, the player is met with another Chozo statue holding an upgrade, that being bombs. The [[../reference#One-way Valves|door is locked]] quickly upon trying to leave, and the statue comes to life to reveal the hostile [[#Torizo|Torizo]] ready to engage in combat.
%% Arm pumping thing to escape prematurely...

==== The Final Missile ====
* After having acquired bombs necessary to clear through the blocked tunnel, the player is greeted by a Chozo statue holding another missile expansion.

==== Terminator Room ====
* Several basic enemies occupy the downward sloping room, but so does the player's "first" energy tank, expanding the players maximum HP as well as full HP restoration.

==== Green Pirates Shaft ====
* As the name implies, [[../reference#Visual Hinting|green space pirates]] occupy the staggered decent of the room. They are [[../reference#Selective Invulnerability|immune to regular weapons fire]], but a single missile does the job nicely, but two carefully placed bombs can also be used in a pinch. Their projectile attack is effective against standing enemies, but the morph ball is an effective evasive maneuver. At the bottom of the room lies both a [[#Lower Mushrooms|blue]] and [[#Golden Statues Room|red]] door opposite to each other.

==== Golden Statues Room ====
* A mossy green cove with a lake and a massive golden statue make this room [[../reference#Significant Landmarking|stand out from all others]] in the game, not to mention the long abandoned hallway leading up to it, signifying an unknown importance. The statue depicts four creatures, each with their own glowing colored eye. If none of the bosses have been defeated up until the room is discovered, nothing will happen and the player can merely take notice.

==== Lower Mushrooms ====
Upon entering, the player encounters an armor plated geemer only [[../reference#Selective Invulnerability|vulnerable to bomb attacks]], as well as the first instance of a kago- a nest-like bio-organism. When disturbed with weapon fire, the kago will [[../reference#Generator|gradually dispense small jumping bugs]] that can [[../reference#Farming Mobs|drop health/ammo]] when killed. With enough weapons fire, the kago will be destroyed. Following the door ahead will lead to an elevator leading to green [[#BRINSTAR|Brinstar]], ending stage 2 of Crateria.

----

=== BRINSTAR ===
%% Stage 1 involves getting the morph ball and missile launcher...
* Stage 2 begins upon taking the elevator room proceeding the lower mushrooms and spits the player out into the grassy [[#Green Brinstar Main Shaft|green brinstar]]. This stage of the game contains harder foes in higher numbers, so the missile expansions and E-tanks collected in Crateria will come into fruition here. After defeating the first boss in green Brinstar, the stage continues as the player descends further down into red Brinstar, and should eventually end up at the elevator room to begin the [[#NORFAIR|Norfair]] adventure.
* Stage 3 begins after acquiring the hi-jump boots

==== Morph Ball Room ====
* Arriving from the descending elevator, the player is again met with an east/west decision on how they will proceed.
* On the west side, of the room, the morph ball can be seen glowing on a pedestal past a structure that will [[../reference#One-way Valves|trap the player from within]], ensuring that they will grab it. Once acquired, they cannot simply escape through the way the came since the structure is too high, but a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|suspicious blue block]] seals a small tunnel. Upon shooting the block, the player can activate the newly-acquired morph ball to escape beneath the structure.
%% Eye-camera thing...

==== Construction Zone ====
* The door across the room on the east side is [[../reference#Teasers|guarded with a red barrier]], and cannot be bypassed at first arrival. The blocks filling the center of the room are of a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|distinct shade of blue]], and will disintegrate upon being shot. Discovering this, the player can shoot their way to the bottom of the room, but unless they have acquired the morph ball from the [[#Morph Ball Room|room prior]], they [[../reference#Teasers|cannot bypass the tunnel]] that leads to the door on the lower floor, and will have to climb back up.
* After acquiring the missile launcher from the [[#First Missile Room|missile room]], the player can immediately access the red door from before and proceed [[#Blue Brinstar Energy Tank Room|forward]].

==== First Missile Room ====
* Upon arriving with the morph ball from the [[#Construction Zone|room prior]], the player will be met with a room with merely a chozo statue holding a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|glowing orb]]. Being inclined to shoot the orb reveals the *missile launcher*. With it, the player has unlocked the ability to unlock red doors at a one-time fee of 5 missiles per door.

==== Blue Brinstar Energy Tank Room ====
* A tunnel at the far-east end of the room reveals a missile expansion on the other side, increasing the maximum missile capacity by 5, extra missiles included.
%% Two empty blocks within the column...
%% Another eye-camera thing...
%% Hidden energy tank can be obtained with hi-jump...
%% Energy tank can be acquired with bomb-hopping technique...

==== Green Brinstar Main Shaft ====
[[file:GreenBrinstarMainShaft.png|{IMG}]]
* Similar in nature to the [[#Parlor and Alcatraz|parlor]], the player will slowly descend upon platforms with several red doors on opposing sides giving the player choices on where to go. Instead of the measly geemers, zeelas crawl around the walls and platforms and take two shots to dispatch instead of 1.
* At the bottom of the shaft, a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|thin layer separates an open space]] beneath the floor, and the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|zeela crawling around the area]] somewhat helps bring notice to that, however attempting to bomb the floor will reveal [[../reference#Teasers|special blocks that require a weapon]] the player does not have access to at the time.

==== Brinstar Pre-Map Room ====
* Northwest-adjacent to the [[#Green Brinstar Main Shaft|main shaft]], the player is confronted with a small sidehopper bouncing along the ceiling, taking three hits to dispatch, as well as a few zeelas crawling along the ground before reaching what appears to be a dead end. If the player were to try and leave the room at this point, they would notice that the [[../reference#One-way Valves|entrance has been locked]], forcing the player to solve the room. Although nothing appears to be wrong to the naked eye, the way the way the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|wall/floor behind the dead end]] continues in combination with the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|camera position]] seems suspicious. Bombing the wall reveals that [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|it is indeed destructible]], and the path forward opens up, as well as the final zeela hidden behind the secret to unlock the doors and allow the player through.
* Past the secret lies the door containing the [[map room]], conveniently placed within the upper-level of the shaft.

==== Early Supers Room ====
[[file:EarlySupersRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* Northeast-adjacent to the [[#Green Brinstar Main Shaft|main shaft]], the early supers room consists of a long, flat platform splitting the room with a few support pillars below it. A pipe coming out of the ground slowly generates flies one-by-one when approached. While moving along the platform, the ground in the middle will disintegrate, sending a walking player down between the pillars where a missile expansion can be grabbed. From there, the bottom of the left pillar can be destroyed with a bomb to exit and try again. Even when successfully running along the fragile blocks however, a [[../reference#Teasers|proximity shutter]] is ready to automatically close the player off from continuing along the platform. The next pillar containing sidehoppers can be accessed, revealing that [[../reference#Teasers|even more shutters]] past the one, but nothing can be done to bypass the third and final pillar. Nothing at all the player can do can destroy the shutters at this time, and the player is forced to head back.
%% Mockball technique to acquire early super missiles...

==== Green Brinstar Fireflea Room ====
[[file:GreenBrinstarFirefleaRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* A faint glow produced by firefleas keeps the whole room alit. Killing one [[../reference#Termination|makes the room darker]] as a result, and killing enough of them will make it very hard or impossible to see the platforms to jump on and spikes to avoid, leaving only the player and doors easily visible.
* A missile refill station awaits the player past the door at the end of the room, and will also reset the firefleas if need be. On the way back through the room, players will be especially punished for killing firefleas recklessly on their way back to the [[#Green Brinstar Main Shaft|shaft]].

==== Dachora Room ====
[[file:DachoraRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* After dealing with a hallway of enemies, the player meets what seems to be a dead end at the end of the hall, but the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|shadows on the other side]] of the wall look suspicious. The player can in fact use bombs to clear a path through. By now, this process [[../reference#Conditioning|should train the player]] into knowing that not all destructible blocks are distinct to the naked eye, and brute force may work when all else fails.
* A [[../reference#Visual Hinting|thin bridge structure with distinctly square blocks]] occupies the space just outside of the destructible wall, but upon bombing it reveals blocks that signify a weapon/ability the player [[../reference#Teasers|does not have]].

==== Big Pink ====
[[file:BigPink.png|{IMG}]]
* Upon entering, the player is immediately granted the option to pick up/down to explore the layered micro-areas of the room. The room is crawling with several fast and strong enemies, so having missiles on deck would prove useful here, and smooth morph ball maneuvers can be used to avoid getting hit. The area is also full of [[../reference#Generators|basic enemy generators]] to help [[../reference#Farming Mobs|slowly replenish]] health/ammo.
* Heading down from the main entrance, the player is first greeted with a foothold they cannot jump high enough to reach. A two sidehoppers and a trap-door await those at the bottom of the foothold, sending them further down into a pit of two aggressive reos. The only thing notable about how the foothold might be reached is a series of [[../reference#Visual Hinting|distinct blocks lining the ceiling]], but [[../reference#Teasers|nothing can be made of them]] at the time.
* On the way out of the trap-door pit, the [[../reference#Teasers|first yellow door]] can be seen on the east side, but the player can merely take notice of it.
* At the bottom of the room, lies a missile expansion as well as a tunnel within a column. The [[../reference#Visual Hinting|cornerstone of the column]] looks highly suspicious, and bombing it will bring the player down into a cove containing a chozo statue holding the charge beam. With it, stronger enemies can be taken care of more efficiently without the cost of missiles. Past the tunnel within the column [[../reference#Teasers|lies a green door]], forcing the player to climb back up the room. Meticulous/conditioned players may opt to [[../reference#Novelty Option|bomb the cornerstone of the statue]] to [[../reference#Teasers|reveal an impassable block]] seen in the floor of the [[#Green Brinstar Main Shaft|main shaft]].
* Towards the top of the room, a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|protrusion in the wall]] with what looks to be a blocked tunnel suggests that it can be explored, and upon doing so will reveal a save room. Along the right side of the top will reveal the door to [[progression]].
* After unlocking and accessing the [[#Spore Spawn Farming Room|first green door]] with the newly-acquired super missiles, the player enters a cave with a blocked-off tunnel. Bombing the rubble will reveal a super missile block. Shooting it will [[../reference#Circuit|loop the player back]] just above where the column was containing the other green door to progression was.

==== Spore Spawn Kihunter Room ====
* Three kihunters roam the hallway preceding the [[#Spore Spawn|boss]] room. The kihunters are large, flying creatures dealing a fair bit of damage that swoop to attack. They normally take six shots to kill, and missiles will quickly dispatch them in one hit, but so will the charge beam if the player has acquired it from the bottom of [[#Big Pink|big pink]] at the cost of 0 missiles.

==== Spore Spawn Super Room ====
* After defeating the [[#Spore Spawn|boss]], the player is led to a room with two pipes, one being a simple [[../reference#Generators|generator]] to help [[../reference#Farming Mobs|replenish]] after the fight, and the other at the end room being a trap-door that the player is inclined to step on. A very long fall down a narrow corridor ends with a Chozo statue holding the super missile upgrade, giving the player 5.

==== Spore Spawn Farming Room ====
* After acquiring the super missiles, the player is brought to a room full of more pipe generators and a green door guarding the exit, with [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|super missiles being the key]] to unlock. Ambient zeelas will also [[../reference#Easter Eggs|fall from the ceiling]] upon the explosive impact of the super missile. The enemies brought forth by the generator can [[../reference#Farming Mobs|replenish any wasted super missiles]] needed to progress past this room as well as the [[#Big Pink|next]].

==== Green Hill Zone ====
* This room features a stair-step like pattern with several "floors" going downward. Several pipes spawning geegas also occupy the room. Upon entering through the main entrance, a foothold can be seen, but is [[../reference#|too high to reach]] merely by jumping.
* At the end of the room lies a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|blue shutter door]], opening and closing when shot with any regular weapons fire- but only from the side the button is facing. Though not obvious to the player, they are actually being [[../reference#One-way Valves|locked from backtracking at all]] should they feel like it, by the shutter.

==== Noob Bridge ====
* A long horizontal stretch of platform occupies the room, splitting it into two halves on the top and bottom. Taking the bottom route leads to a complete dead end, as nothing the player can do can bypass the pillar connecting the platform with the floor, so the only way to cross is the top half. The floor on the top half will disintegrate upon being stepped on, forcing a walking player to fall through and start over.
* Spikes line the top of the ceiling above the disintegrating floor, [[../reference#Deterrence|deincentivizing the player to try jumping]] across the fragile blocks, as it isn't the intended solution. Unless the player has learned by now that they can run by holding B, they will [[../reference#Skill Check|need to learn here in order to progress]]. Furthermore, the shutter in the [[#Green Hill Zone|previous room]] will prevent the player from going any further back to ensure the player that they do have the means necessary to cross the bridge.

==== Red Tower ====
[[file:BigPink.png|{IMG}]]
* Upon entering the tower, a foothold can be seen above by jumping, but is [[../reference#Teasers|too high to reach]], forcing the player to descend.
* After descending downward, the player comes across a cubby blocked off by blocks and walls, with a yellow door being visible on the west side. Attempting to bomb the block on the side of the door will only reveal more of the [[../reference#Teasers|same type of weapon block]] seen before in the [[#Green Brinstar Main Shaft|green shaft]] and [[#Big Pink|big pink]] that are currently indestructible. By this point, the player should be trained to try using brute force to find the hidden tunnel directly beneath, but box on the right can also be bombed to reveal a beetom from within. In a panic, the player is inclined to try spamming morph ball bombs to kill it since nothing else will, and in doing so can also reveal the same hidden tunnel beneath, leading not to the yellow door but descending further down the tower.
* After descending further, the player will be [[../reference#One-way Valves|locked from within again]], as they will fall for a good while down the shaft full of back-and-forth roaming rippers, with no way back up the tower, although an [[energy refill station]] and the door to progression are found at opposing sides at the bottom.

==== Bat Room ====
[[file:BatRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* The west half of the room from the main entrance consists of two footholds on either side divided by a relatively shallow pool of water. In order to successfully cross, the player can either perform a running jump, or a well-timed regular jump to reach the centerpiece leading the the east half of the room.
* There, another centerpiece can be seen between two more pools of with spikes, as well as two idling on the ceiling just above it. From previous encounters with similar enemies, [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|the player can infer]] that they will dive-bomb the player as soon as the centerpiece is approached. The player can dispatch them prematurely before giving them that chance.
* The spikes between the sides of the second centerpiece are especially dangerous since because they are underwater, they will take longer to escape from as the player's movement will be hindered. The energy refill station in the [[#Red Tower|previous room]] can be useful to players low on health after the ordeal, as they can heal damage taken from the spikes and try the room again.

==== Below Spazer ====
[[file:BelowSpazer.png|{IMG}]]
* Immediately upon entering, the yapping maw guarding the small platforms needed to cross the pool of water catches the player's eye. Before challenging it though, the player is inclined to dispatch the cacatac shooting projectiles at the far end of the room. The player must perform a [[../reference#Skill Check|swift platforming exercise]] to avoid being grabbed by the disturbed yapping maw to proceed to the centerpiece, and once more to proceed [[#Glass Tunnel|forward]].
* A hole in the ceiling with a foothold can be seen and accessed above the centerpiece, revealing what appears to be a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|room above the ceiling]], but [[../reference#Reacharound|no way of accessing it from there]]. A [[../reference#Visual Hinting|single suspicious block]] can be easily missed just above the room's entrance, but the foothold above it is [[../reference#Teasers|too high to be reached]] at the moment.
* After having acquired the hi-jump boots [[#Hi Jump Boots Room|somewhat locally]], the player can return and reach the foothold the block covers over and discover the tunnel leading to the mysterious room with the green door occupying the ceiling. If the player is not holding right while bombing the second block in the tunnel, they will fall through the [[hidden destructible block underneath]], dropping them nearby the yapping maw below and forcing them to retrace their steps. With all of the blockage having been cleared however, they have no reason to fail again and can simply [[../reference#Streamlining|breeze through]] and grab the spazer beam past the green door.

==== Warehouse Entrance ====
* Upon first entering, the player is highly inclined to take the elevator down to continue progression, but an attentive player may [[../reference#Visual Hinting|notice the map]] hinting at more that what meets the eye, as it shows an extension to the right of the room. The [[../reference#Symbolic Hinting|super missile blocks]] reveal themselves upon being bombed, and the player can access the extension after destroying one, revealing room with a [[../reference#Teasers|foothold barely too high to reach]] with the [[../reference#Landmarking|husk of a monster's face]] looming over the entryway.
* Using the newly-acquired hi-jump boots, the player can return and reach the foothold from before and continue, if they hadn't already discovered it.

==== Warehouse Zeela Room ====
* Marking the beginning of stage 3 of Brinstar, the player is brought into a cramped room crawling with zeelas and a girder bridge above a space containing a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|rogue zeela]], as well as the map showing space below. Inclined to shoot or bomb their way under the girder, the player can indeed do so through a small opening and descend further into an area with a [[locked door]].
* Although the map shows an extension only directly east of the girder bridge, no destructible blocks are available to use up there. The player being inclined to bomb below the bridge opposite to the locked door will reveal a secret morph ball tunnel on the right with a vertical door leading forward, establishing that the [[../reference#Mechanical Hinting|correct path may not necessarily exist on the map]].
* During the backtrack after defeating Kraid and acquiring the varia suit, the once unlocked door becomes [[#Warehouse Energy Tank Room|unlocked]].

==== Warehouse Kihunter Room ====
* After deling with a swarm of kihunters patrolling the room, a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|depression in the floor]] can be seen at the far east end, and bombing it will unlock a tunnel leading to the nearby save room.
* Although the map shows an [[../reference#Visual Hinting|extention below the room]], the solution once again isn't as straightforward as following the map. Bombing or shooting the [[../reference#Visual hinting|suspicious crack in the floor plating]] in the center of the room will reveal another secret tunnel leading to the path forward.

==== Baby Kraid Room ====
* Several green space pirates as well as a baby kraid patrol the long hallway, and must be defeated to unlock the doors and proceed. The space pirates are straightforward (especially with the spazer beam) but the baby kraid will send a barrage of [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|projectiles of varying heights]] to avoid well before it's in view. The spikes hanging from the ceiling will also punish players for [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|jumping too high]] over the baby kraid's projectiles

==== Kraid Eye Door Room ====
* Upon entering, an open space behind the ceiling above the door can be seen an broken into by shooting the ceiling open to reveal a green door containing an energy refill station next to a missile refill station, conveniently placed before and after the boss. However, a gamet generator can also be used to slowly farm health/ammo.
* A [[../reference#Easter Eggs|dead soldier]] can be found lying on the ground before the first encounter with a gedora, a bio-organic door shield that [[../reference#Peakaboo Weakspot|periodically exposes its eye]], taking three missiles (or one super) to dispatch. The projectiles they shoot after exposing the eye for too long inflict minor damage, but also absorb missile fire. After dispatching the gedora, the [[#Kraid|boss]] room becomes accessible, and the varia suit is unlocked after emerging victorious, bringing Brinstar's third stage to a close.

==== Warehouse Energy Tank Room ====
* The small room is infested with beetoms, and they will attack immediately upon entering as entrance locks until they are all dispatched. After doing so, the player may be inclined to explore the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|suspicious cracks in the plating]] around, but only one in the ceiling contains an energy tank upgrade.


----


=== NORFAIR ===
* Stage 1 of Norfair is somewhat short-lived, but serves its purpose in both providing the player the hi-jump boots necessary to backtrack toward the [[#Warehouse Entrance|warehouse]] and [[#Below Spazer|other room]] seen before, and also establishing several new areas the player is [[../reference#Systematic Gatekeeping|gatekept from]] within a relatively short amount of time.
* Norfair stage 2 begins after the player defeats Kraid and returns with the varia suit to explore the depths that were too hot before. In doing so, they will eventually find the

==== Business Center ====
* Upon riding the elevator down for the first time, the player gets their first impression of Norfair in tall shaft-structured room similarly seen before in [[#Green Brinstar Main Shaft|brinstar]]. Besides the [[../reference#Teaser|yellow door]] in the middle-left of the room, the player has the means to access all of the doors in the shaft.
* The bottom of the shaft lined with a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|thin layer of blocks with an open space and an sova behind it]] can be opened up to reveal another door.

==== Ice Beam Gate Room ====
* Coming from the green door seen in the business center, a walking player will be quickly stopped by a proximity shutter preventing further access into the hall. Although a running start would also work, an [[../reference#Visual Hinting|open space within a tunnel]] can be seen below the floor, and bombs will allow the player to bypass the gate from below, but a [[../reference#Teasers|second gate blocks any form of progression]], as it cannot be sped past or bombed under/over at this time, forcing the player to retreat.
* A sova can also be seen crawling along the tunnel in the ceiling, most likely [[../reference#Visual Hinging|subtly implying]] that the tunnel below mentined before can also be crawled along.

==== Cathedral Entrance ====
* Immediately entering during stage 1, the player is [[../reference#Deterrence|contemporarily blocked off]] in all immediate directions preventing them from committing to exploring the room as they are [[../reference#Tick Damage|gradually being cooked alive]] by the intense heat, forcing them back to [[../reference#Teasers|explore later]].
* After returning with the varia suit, the player can safely enter and bomb the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|narrow foothold below them]] to [[#Cathedral|continue forth]] and explore.

==== Frog Speedway ====
[[file:FrogSpeedwaySmile.png|{IMG}]]
* East-adjacent to the save room to the right of the shaft, frog speedway consists of a long, narrow hallway filled with blockage and crawling with beetoms. However, bombing the rubble will reveal a [[../reference#Symbolic Hinting|distinct speed booster block]], forcing the player to [[../reference#Teasers|retreat until acquired]].

==== Hi Jump Energy Tank Room ====
[[file:HiJumpEnergyTankRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* From the bottom-west door from the shaft, the player is rewarded with an energy tank as the [[../reference#One-way Valves|door behind locks]], but a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|sova scurrying within a tunnel]] in the corner of the room can also be seen below the bridge the player stands upon. Inclined to follow it, two blocks can be disintegrated upon contact allowing the player access to the rest of the room. As the player descends, the player has [[no way of escaping once]] they've commited, as they cannot jump high enough to reach the foothold directly above to leave, forcing them into the adjacent door to obtain the next upgrade.
* After just acquiring the hi-jump boots, the player can reach the foothold to escape and grab a missile expansion on their way out of the room.

==== Hi Jump Boots Room ====
[[file:HiJumpBootsRoom.png|{IMG}]]
* A Chozo statue can immediately be seen behind the dividing wall, and upon shooting the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|suspicious plating]] near the top of the wall, access becomes granted. Using the newly-acquired hi-jump boots, the player can jump back over the wall from the trough letting them escape.

==== Crocomire Escape ====
* Entering from below the destructible bridge within the business center, a missile expansion on the ground can be seen behind a shutter door. However, even if the player has acquired the varia suit to be able to even widthstand the intense heat, the shutter cannot be bypassed as the green button is on the [[../reference#Reacharound|other side]].

==== Cathedral ====
[[file:Cathedral.png|{IMG}]]
%% Enemy can get itself positioned in a way where the player can accidentally shoot a block under the lava, uncovering a missile from within

==== Rising Tide ====
* Upon entering, the ground will begin to shake, and the lava from below will begin to rise from the ground and subside after some time. The player must consecutively jump along several narrow pillars and platforms to avoid the scurrying sovas and also [[../reference#Floor is Lava|falling in the lava]]. Several squeepts leap straight up from the lava at randomly varying heights. They cannot practically be killed, so [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|they should be respected]]. As the player continues Dragons will eventually emerge from the lava and launch projectiles in an arc pattern that can be [[../reference#Yielding Procedure|avoided by crouching or morphing upon the pillars]]. The dragons cannot be killed easily with normal weapon fire, but three missiles will do the job.

==== Bubble Mountain ====
* Bubble mountain is a large, tall room made up of several parts split horizontally into two halves- one full of green bubbles and the other full of metal pipes and blocks.
* The somewhat [[../reference#Visual Hinting|conspicuous metal pipe with a sova crawling under it]] just outside the main entrance can be bombed, but only to reveal the [[../reference#Symbolic Hinting|power bomb blocks]] it's made up of.
* A save room can be found in the middle-west adjacent room, but two high footholds- one further right and one directly above- [[../reference#Teasers|cannot be reached]] even with hi-jump boots.
* At the far-east end of the room, the player can bomb the [[../reference#Visual Hinting|small pieces of pipe]] that descend in a staggered pattern to an underground cubby containing a missile expansion. From there and even while bombing, [[../reference#Visual Hinting|sovas can be seen scurrying]] within the wall just outside of the cubby.
* In the very center of the room sits a [[../reference#Visual Hinting|suspicious altar containing a thin layer of blocks]]. Bombing them allows access below, and into series of tunnels within the wall occupied by sovas. The sovas can be dispatched with well-placed boms as they approach from within the tunnel.

== BOSSES ==

=== Ridley I ===
* This is a [[stage fight]] primarily set to establish Ridley's control over the infant metroid's tank. Ridley's primary attacks consist of swooping, tail swiping, and fireballs. These attacks are executed in an RNG cycle. Since Ridley's body does the most damage, one possible strategy is to try and get hit by the tail to minimize damage taken. The tail will occasionally spin and strike toward the player. The fireball attack is a volley projectile that [[../reference#Area of Effect|spreads out]] when hitting the floor or wall. This is a good opportunity to shoot him. Once the player's health drops below a certain point, he will fly away and the fight will end, but if the player manages to shoot him enough, he will [[../reference#Easter Eggs|briefly folly about]], temporarily dropping the tank and flying away, ending the fight.

=== Torizo ===

=== Spore Spawn ===
* Upon the [[../reference#One-way Valves|vertical door locking]] when entering, spores will begin falling from the ceiling, and deal minimal damage when touched. The boss reveals itself as a large round object oscillating in a figure-eight pattern, dealing damage upon contact. The fight involves the player avoiding contact with both the boss and its [[../reference#Bullet Rain|continuous rain of spores]] and quickly repositioning to shoot the [[../reference#Peakaboo Weakspot|temporarily exposed internals]] from the side platforms, as they are [[../reference#Shrouded Weakspot|covered from the bottom]]. As the fight progresses, the boss will speed up oscillation after crossing a health threshold. The morph ball is a very good tool to avoid contact from the boss as it cannot reach, but the spores can still hit you. The spores can be dispatched with weapon fire to [[../reference#Farming Mobs|refill health/ammo]] during the fight, but the player must briefly exit the safety of the morph ball in order to shoot. If spores are in the wrong place at the wrong time when the boss opens up, they can knock the player off balance and ruin a chance to strike. With careful positioning, shooting, and precalculation in relation to where spores are located, the player can find and create the optimal time and place to strike the boss. Depending on how good the players is, they can shoot up to 2 or even 3 missiles in one strike.
* Another strategy is to not grab the item drops from the dispatched spores and keep them airborne for as long as possible to prevent or "back-up" more spores from spawning.
* It can be noted that the charge beam does double the normal amount of damage against the boss, but considering how long it takes to prepare, and the fact that you can only shoot 1 charge shot, it isn't as effective as rapid missile fire.
* Once defeated, the dried corpse of the boss can be climbed upon to escape the room from the top end to [[#Spore Spawn Super Room|progress further]].
