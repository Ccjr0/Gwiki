=== The Phantom Limbs ===
* The small ruins area directly behind the starting point serves as a kind of environmental training area, getting the player used to sneaking and climbing over and along walls before the real meat of the mission.
* The first mini-outpost consists of merely two basic soldiers, as well as ammo refills and a suppressor replacement to establish that they can be found, but also offers the player forgiveness on their first tactical encounter.

=== C2W ===
* The player must find and destroy 3 radio communication devices located upon several rooftops within the [[#Eastern Communications Post|Eastern Communications Post]], or alternatively destroy the single indoor radio system within one of the buildings.
