== AREAS ==
=== Ruined Courtyard ===
* Ruined Courtyard features a [[glossary#Timed Consecutive Action Sequence|timed consecutive action sequence]] with morph-ball bomb slots, and snowy platforms mixed with an [[glossary#Environmental Transformation|environmental transformation]] section where the water rises. In-between the start of the timed action sequence and the goal at the top of the level, a morph-ball tunnel containing an energy tank is [[glossary#Visual Hinting|hinted at]] with a glowing rim. Once grabbed, the timed action and transformation sequences must be done over again to reach the top and proceed.

=== Tower of Light ===
* Tower of light is a very tall, cylindrical room featuring sets of platforms reaching to the top. On four sections along the circumference of the cylindrical room there are [[stress points]] indicating that they can be damaged. The stress points can be destroyed with 3 missiles each for a total of 12 missiles minimum for each round. Upon dispatching the stress points, the room [[glossary#Environmental Transformation|truncates itself from the middle]], thereby lowering the upper part of the room, where the player repeats the process twice more, with increased challenge coming from moving [[missile reflecting enemies]] along the stress points and [[sun rays obscuring your vision]]. [[glossary#Quantitative Gatekeeping|36 missiles are required]] to complete the room in one go. [[glossary#Replenishment Mob|Replenishment mobs]] are used to assist with keeping enough missiles.

=== Observatory Access ===
* Upon entering from a vertical door, the player is greeted with stacked crates with turrets behind them. If activated by proximity, the turrets will [[blast open the crates]] and shoot the player.

=== Hall of the Elders ===
* A pseudo-miniboss fight always begins in this room, but it's

== BOSSES ==
=== Hive Mecha ===
* Hive-mecha fight requires killing increasingly present mobile enemies and tracking them with [[radar]] and [[glossary#Audible Hinting|audio queues]] to expose the weak-point of stationary boss. Rinse and repeat three times to win.

=== Plated Beetle ===
* Plated beetle fight begins with the player fighting [[glossary#Minions|many regular beetles]] at once in the arena until enough are killed to summon the plated beetle. It encourages player to use the dodge ability [[glossary#Visual Hinting|at the correct time]] to [[glossary#Circle-strafing|circle around the enemy]] to shoot its [[glossary#Backside Weakspot|exposed backside]]

=== Incinerator Drone ===
* Incinerator drone fight requires you to jump and duck past the boss's [[glossary#Circle-strafing|circular attack pattern]] and to shoot the [[glossary#Peakaboo Weakspot|temporarily exposed weak point]] while dealing with [[glossary#Minions|increasingly present weaker enemies]]

=== Flahgraa ===
* Flahgraa fight requires you to shoot to stun the boss and deactivate nodes to incapacitate the boss in order to damage it

=== Thardus ===
* Thardus requires you to [[glossary#Dynamic Weakspot|locate its weak-point]] with thermal visor, attack it, then switch back to normal visor and target the same point to destroy that point. Rinse and repeat. [[glossary#Aesthetic Presentation|(Some weather effects too)]]

== EXPLOITS ==
=== Early Space Jump Boots ===
* Space jump boots are able to be acquired much earlier than intended, and in multiple different ways depending on the version of the game being played.

=== Early Plasma Beam ===

== THOUGHTS ==
* I think that given the task Retro Studios was given with, they hit the nail on the head making Metroid's debut in 3D, and filling in Super Metroid's shoes. Although not perfect, Prime serves as a great first-person action/adventure game - and perhaps the only of its kind - with such a heavy focus on the MV formula. The atmosphere just great.

* I think there was lots of thought put into the level design from the micro to the macro level. The levels and areas flow together nicely all things considered, and the emphasis on exploration and encouraging the player to check back on the things they were blue-balled on before was pretty good. Although it does a good job at honoring Super Metroids design philosophy and atmosphere, the game feel leaves some to be desired- as it is after all a single-stick first-person shooter, and silky, satisfying movement mechanics would have been much harder to implement. The targeting system does its best to keep things smooth, but looking around can feel stiff and slow at times. (I wish there was a sensitivity option somewhere). Platforming while not bad, isn't nearly as smooth and satisfying as in Super Metroid.

* Here's some nitpicks and other thoughts. Although the flow between levels is generally good, I would've maybe liked it if there were more breakable or uncoverable shortcuts to make traveling even more streamlined across areas than they already were. In this way I feel like the grapple beam is underutilized, as it is a prime candidate for this job, but it is also just fun to use. I think it would've been viable to use something other than strictly the "grapple points" as use for the grapple beam, such as maybe some more natural or mechanical elements that fit the environment you're in. I think the spiderball could've been used more often too, especially in some of those slower morphball-only sections.

* Another thing I notice is that most of the extra/optional powerups aren't particularly exciting/efficient - as in they mainly consist of 5-stock missile expansions to add to your massive stockpile of missiles (which is nice, but at some point it becomes like a diminishing returns effect) and power bomb expansions which really don't serve much of a purpose besides breaking certain walls and saying "fuck it" to enemies that you just want to deal with quickly and get over with, and considering how easy it is for power bomb refills to drop from enemies anyway, these expansions really don't feel like they serve much of a meaningful purpose at all. There's also the elemental super missiles for each respective beam weapon, but the vanilla super missile is simply the most efficient in terms of both effectiveness and ammo efficiency in the vast majority of cases, so the other ones are really just "meh" even if they're kinda cool.

* I also question the game's ability to point the player in the right direction at a couple points in the game. In this way, I think the developers relied too much on the hint system to mask flaws in the level design. Two examples stick out to me and those are the half-pipe in Tallon Overworld and sunken frigate entrance after grabbing the ice beam. I understand why the developers included the hint system- to guide players who inevitably get lost to their next progression point without giving _too_ much information away on how to get there (most of the time). I just think that most of the items and progression points did this well enough on their own without the need for the hint system, while a select few did not. The half-pipe example requires the player to go _all_ the way back to Tallon Overworld after acquiring the boost ball to locate a specific and easy to miss half-pipe that is required to get the space jump boots. It's not the backtracking itself that particularly bothers me, it's just that the answer the boost ball is too obtuse on its own (without the hint) to justify its design choice, I think. The most egregious example of this comes mid-game after the ice beam is acquired. Once the spider ball is acquired, you are greeted with an ice door upon entering the next elevator room. This ice door was to serve as the main hint on where to go after acquiring the ice beam shortly after. Or perhaps even the ice door in the research core. The problem is that these doors are easy to ignore and forget, and on top of that- once acquiring the ice beam- you are given two more paths to explore immediately. One leads to Magmoor Caverns for optional stuff, and the other leads to the entrance to the sunken frigate which is also blocked by an ice door. If the player enters the frigate before going back to Phendrana Drifts to grab the gravity suit, then they will have to though a slog of underwater scavenger hunting and platforming only to be told to go straight back all the way up from where they came. This blatant flaw easily could've been fixed in a couple ways just off the top of my head. One way is to move the door that drops you into the frigate crash site from Chozo Ruins _behind_ the body of water, that way the player is still gatekept by that instead of given premature access to the frigate. Another way to solve this is to simply put a door early on in the frigate that's inaccessible to anyone without the gravity suit, so that the player doesn't get premature access to the reactor core and cargo freight just to trek back in the most crude way possible- being explicitly told to.

* Another thing that slightly bothered me is the repetitive use of particular enemies in sometimes in early/mid game (Flying Pirates and Shriekbats in particular get overused) and in some instances of the game the topography feels too similar (cylindrical access tunnels get used alot early/mid-game). One blemish with the level design in this game which I particularly disliked (disregarding the no-hint stuff), was retrieving the artifact of newborn. I feel like the fix would be very simply to put it closer to the entrance/exit point of the area that its in (being the Phazon Mines depths) instead of being right in the awkward middle area that its in, and given that there isn't a backtrack-phase in that area like the other artifacts because its the very end of the game, there's no real way to go back and get it that doesn't feel like a real slog.
