After thinking it over, I agree that the supernatural element would be an inappropriate (or at least totally unnecessary) element for story progression.

My main concerns regard how much focus/priority we're giving to the lore/story element of the game (at least in our regrouping sessions), as the gameplay mechanics (given that this is a metroid-vania type game) should be paramount (approx 90 to 10). Since the game was always concieved from gameplay mechanics since the very beginning, (since even it was still a mobile game) all the progress previously made on it (alot btw) was guided by our visions of interesting gameplay concepts, atmosphere, and how they would tie together. I think this is much healthier for the development and final product. Without our original guiding light, we lose sight and passion of what made us interested in making a game like this in the first place.

What else somewhat concerns me is the long-term development relationship between me and Cory, as we clearly come from totally different gaming backgrounds and value certain principles and ideas more than others in the realm of game design. This concerns me mainly for two reasons:
1. It seems apparent that Cory won't easily find motivation
