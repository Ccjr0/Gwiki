- Completing boss fights permanently raises health bar and ammo carrying capacity
- To progress further at this point, the player must look on the back of the game CD case to speak with Meryl to proceed
	- **{out of box option}**
- Tank hanger exit requires the player to dodge a series of vertical moving infrared lasers to avoid being locked in with gas. The lasers can be easily seen with thermal goggles or by smoking
	{yield to proceed} {out of box option}
- Claymore mines can be crawled upon to be picked up, or can be detected with an optional mine detector that can be found in the tank hanger once you have a level 2 card
- Raven tank fight has the player fight a mobile tank with a main and secondary gun in a snowfield. You first need to get close enough to the tank to invalidate its main gun by taking advantage of the terrain and crawling along and behind hills to avoid being shot. Once within range, a soldier will try to track you with the secondary gatling gun while the tank body itself is highly maneuverable and dangerous- although it can be compromised with chaff grenades and explosives. The only way to defeat the boss is to lob a grenade into the manhole with replenishing (although limited) grenade and ration supplies scattered accross the snowfield.
- Gray fox fight requires the player to fight dodge, and chase the boss in a CQC duel. Gray fox will dodge any bullets, but chaff grenades can stun him. Gray fox has a variety of attacks for the player to react accordingly to, and the office cubicles allow for looping to an extent. As the fight progresses, Gray fox can turn semi-invisible and teleport behind the player.
- Mantis fight involves the player dodging items being thrown and flown around in different distinct patterns. To defeat the boss you need to plug the controller into port 2

- Backtrack to the armory to grab the PSG-1
- Sniper wolf fight involves the player engaging a sniper duel down a very long corridor. Peering down the corridor by hugging the wall and waiting for an opening or baiting out the shot by briefly exposing yourself and reacting to the laser lets you position and take aim. The boss runs between columns to change positions and hide in and out of cover. Taking the optional pentazamin will temporarily stop body tremors
- Interogation room involves the player mashing O quickly for a period of time to maintain your dropping health to stay alive, or give in with SELECT and alter the final ending.
- In the prison, the player must wait for the guard to use the bathroom to either crawl under the bed, or fake blood with ketchup in order for the guard to open the door to investigate upon returning

- Blast furnace features a moving crane arm moving along an edge that the player must either crouch/sidle past {yield to proceed} or destroy with a missile, {out-of-box option} an {unlockable shortcut-elevator}, and a secret room with steam geysers of varying heights {yield to proceed}
- Vulcan raven fight involves a game of cat and mouse between a large grid of containers, where the player needs to take down raven while avoiding being shot down in his massive line of sight between the corridors of the containers. Raven gets faster as his health lowers and can damage certain containers blocking access between them as the fight progresses. Explosive rockets are viable, but placed explosives are most efficient. Your rations will freeze if not kept warm by keeping them equipped but can be warmed by holding them out in your main slot
	{topographic grid} {out of box option}
- Metal gear fight involves the player avoiding the boss's the primary attacks while shooting first its radome {weak point}, then cockpit. Metal gear has 3 ranged attacks: homing rockets, gatling gun, and laser- each with their own respective method and range of avoiding them. Starting midrange and moving toward MG while anticipating the 3 homing missiles firing (or watching the camera) lets you avoid them, but can set you up for a following laser attack for big damage if you dont move away quickly. The tracking gatling gun can be avoided by maintaining side movement.
- Extreme difficulty removes natural rations from the game, encouraging the player to kill guards so that they can drop them, adding a whole new way or idea of playing the game {mechanical realignment}
- Extreme difficulty rewards players for not using all diazepam on the first SW fight
- Apparently cameras can be destroyed with the Stinger launcher and Nikita {out-of-box option}

### Areas
##### Dock
- Dock starts the game with the player being fully shrouded in cover by barrels and a pipe unit. To proceed, the player must crawl under the unit. **{basic mechanical tutorial}** Optionally, a ration is visible underwater as soon as the game starts, and can be grabbed by going down the stairs and underwater to grab it. **{visual hinting}**
- Once the player crawls past the pipe unit, a wall is revealed with a guard patrolling nearby in the main part of the room, where there are 4 large stacks of shipping crates in a square-grid pattern. **{topographic intersection}** Here, the player is encouraged to hug the wall and wait for the guard to resume patrol. **{yield to proceed}**
- A puddle is waiting to the right after going past the guard to trigger the guard's sense of sound. **{sound emitter}** **{mechanical hinting}** The player is forced to either move up, right, or if the player gets caught, optionally jump off down into the water to escape. **{out of box option}**
- There is an identical pipe unit on the reciprocating side of the level with another ration behind it. **{topographic reciprocation}** A forklift in the far northeast corner is good for hiding behind to wait for the elevator to come down and sneak inside, and also has a ration behind it. **{wait to proceed}**

##### Heliport
- Heliport has two points of exit- one ventilation opening in lower and one higher up the stairs, both on the far north end of the level. It also has moving spotlights along the helipad in the center that have a repeating pattern with different points of entry to bypass them and optionally a set of chaff grenades in the middle if you can grab them as a reward for challenging the lights. #yield to proceed
- There is an optional surveillance camera room on the west end of the level which features a swivelling camera with a shipping crate and crevice as blind spots, and the room holds stun grenades as a reward. #mechanical hinting #yield to proceed
- Further up the level on the northwest side there is a ventilation opening with sleeping guard in front of it as well as a camera. In the far north there is a truck that can be used as cover (in, around, and under) and can even be climbed into to optionally recieve a SOCOM pistol with limited ammo.
- In the east there is a snowy area with 3 boxes in a striaght vertical line that can be used as cover from a patrolling guard. #topographic consecutive cover The guard can see the player's footprints in the snow and follow them indefinitely- occasionally looking behind. #breadcrumbs #mechanical hinting There is also a ditch to the left of this snowy area to crawl past the guard completely into the north area with the truck. #out of box option Behind the final box however there is a ration, followed by an upward staircase guarded by a swivelling camera that can be bypassed through its blindspot #mechanical hinting #yield to proceed

##### Hangar
- Hangar can be entered from two ways depending on how you finish the Heliport. #non linear access If you enter from the top side, you will be brought to the ceiling ventilation shaft where you will end up being brought down a ladder and start on the second floor where the floor is covered with a noisy metal plating. You can find chaff grenades and the optional thermal goggles within a cargo room with a security camera. If you enter from the bottom side, you will follow the rats to the bottom of the hangar and exit on the east side of the bottom floor of the hanger. The hangar features two large tanks that can be hid behind  extra ammo for socom is hidden under the main staircase, as well as optional thermal goggles on second floor. Optionally the player can backtrack once getting level 1 card to retrieve the cardboard box A and socom supressor from previously locked doors in the up and downstairs respectively

- Cell
    * Cell

- Armory
    - Armory features a grid-like layout of individual rooms each with locked or unlocked doors of varying card levels, as well as destructable walls both containing optional items on either end of the north side of the level and story progression on the south. {topographic grid}
    - It also features new traps such as infrared lasers and floor traps that can both bee seen with the thermal goggles, and most rooms have areas to hid in

- Nuclear warhead storage building
    * Nuke storage building features crates of dismantled warheads all around, so using standard weaponry is disabled

- Nuke building B1
    * Nuke building B1 features a bathroom where guards occasionally break their routine to go and pee. They can be followed in and are vulnerable while doing so. There is also a Nikita launcher behind a door in the main computer room, as well as ammo hidden under the desks

- Nuke building B2
    * Nuke building B2 features a high-voltage generator that electricutes the floor along the long corridors past the main door. The generator is visible through the glass as soon as you enter, but the only way to destroy it is with a remote-controlled missile from the nikita launcher. The corridors are equipped with armed security cameras that can potentially shoot down the rocket unless you accelerate. Once you destroy the generator, the player can proceed but the corridors are still filled with a poisonous gas that slowly drains your O2 meter. An optional gas mask is behind one of the many doors in the poisonous corridors, as well as plenty of ammo refills, NVG and the way to progression.

- Blast furnace
    * Blast Furnace

### Exploits
- Some bosses have an infinite loop that you can send them in, trivializing challenge to some degree
	{infinite loop exploit}
- Some rooms you can just run straight in and grab exactly what you need, completely avoiding guards' vision
- Equipping and re-equipping the PSG1 resets the shake counter

### Thoughts
MGS1 is an interesting one coming back to. Coming back to at after so long and after playing Metroid Prime and MGSV made me dislike the game at first. This was mainly because I was directly comparing the gameplay from both of those games to this one which in hindsight was not the best idea. After thoroughly playing through the game, Ive come to appreciate what it is on its own after forcing myself to adapt and overcome to its differences from MGSV. It is a classic for sure but it is certainly not without its flaws- most of them IMO having to do with too with uninspired/questionable level design late game. Not to mention the backtracking, while I personally dont mind it certainly is nowhere near as "gracefully" executed or perhaps "flow-ey" as the Metroid games. Since the game has a very limited camera situation, the radar system is a very useful tool to help give some spacial awareness to the player instead of the player having to use the stationary first-person view constantly or rely on memory or "gamesense", and since the guards' vision-cone is limited and clealy defined, I believe the radar system is helpful (though not essential) for a fully cohesive gameplay experience in this game, at least on the first playthrough.
