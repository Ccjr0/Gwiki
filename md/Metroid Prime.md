### Areas
* Ruined Courtyard features a timed consecutive action sequence with morph-ball bomb slots, and snowy platforms mixed with an environmental transformation section where the water rises. In-between the start of the timed action sequence and the goal at the top of the level is a morph-ball tunnel containing an energy tank. Once grabbed, the timed action and transformation sequences must be done over to reach the top and proceed.

* Flahgraa requires you to shoot to stun the boss and deactivate nodes to incapacitate the boss in order to damage it

### Exploits

### Thoughts
I think that given the task Retro Studios was given with, they hit the nail on the head making Metroids debut in 3D, and filling in Super Metroids shoes. Although not perfect, Prime serves as a great first-person action/adventure game - and perhaps the only of its kind - with such a heavy focus on the MV formula. The atmosphere just great. I think there was lots of thought put into the level design from the micro to the macro level. The levels and areas flow together nicely all things considered, and the emphasis on exploration and encouraging the player to check back on the things they were blue-balled on before was pretty good. Although it does a good job at honoring Super Metroids design philosophy and atmosphere, the game feel leaves some to be desired- as it is after all a single-stick shooter. The targeting system does its best to keep things smooth, but looking around can feel stiff and slow at times. Platforming while not bad, isn't nearly as smooth and satisfying as in Super Metroid.

Heres some nitpicks and other thoughts. Although the flow between levels is generally good, I wouldve maybe liked it if there were more breakable or uncoverable shortcuts to make traveling even more streamlined accross areas than they already were. In this way I feel like the grapple beam is underutilized, as it is a prime candidate for this job, but it is also just fun to use. I think it wouldve been viable to use something other than strictly the "grapple points" as use for the grapple beam, such as maybe some more natural or mechanical elements that fit the environment youre in. Another thing I notice is that most of the extra/optional powerups arent particularly exciting/efficient - as in they mainly consist of 5-stock missile expansions to add to your massive stockpile of missiles (which is nice, but at some point you question whether it becomes like a diminishing returns effect) and power bomb expansions which really dont serve much of a purpose besides breaking certain walls and saying "fuck it" to enemies that you just want to deal with quickly and get over with, and considering how easy it is for power bomb refills to drop from enemies anyway, these expansions really dont feel like they serve much of a meaningful purpose at all. Theres also the elemental super missiles for each respective beam weapon, but the vanilla super missle is simply the most efficient in terms of both effectiveness and ammo efficiency in the vast majority of cases, so the other ones are really kinda just "meh". Another thing that slightly bothered me is the repetitive use of particular enemies in sometimes in early/mid game (Flying Pirates and Shriekbats in particular get overused) and in some instances of the game the topography feels too similar. There was only one blemish with the level design in this game which I particulary disliked, and it was retrieving the artifact of newborn. I feel like the fix would be very simply to put it closer to the exit point of the sub-area that its in (being the Mines depths) but being right in the awkward middle area that its in, and given that there isnt a backtrack-phase in that area like the other artifacts because its the very end of the game, theres no way to go back and get it that doesn't feel like a real slog.
