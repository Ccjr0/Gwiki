Basic target practice for gate progression early game (shoot to proceed)
Atmospheric visual flare such as visor condensation early game (presentation)
Scan certain panels to unlock doors/elevators/activate objects ()
Basic crippled enemies early game
Introducing abilities for progression purposes early game (charge beam to destroy rubble)
Ambient creatures reveal map room (hinting)
Envoronmental hazards such as electricity/fire etc.
Turret defense disabling through use of scanning panels (optional)
Timed escape sequence using collection of (some) basic tasks learned through the introduction
Abilities you've become familiar with lost, and must be reaquired
Optional areas and micro-areas visible and some blocked off for later abilities as soon as you reach Tallon IV
Mysterious artifact temple looks highly significant, even though we cannot immediately make sense of what it is or what to do there. (significant landmark)
Elevators serve as access between macro-areas
Powerups emit subtle sound when nearby
Chozo tree doesn't immediately look special, but reflects blasts just like blast shields (visual implication)
Certain walls defined with certain named materials, implying they can be broken with a respective ability
Key item rooms lock the player within to escape using the respective item (one-way valves)
Missle launcher useful in combat, allows for breaking certain walls/barriers, and is particularly useful (though optional) in the NEXT proceding boss fight
Morph ball allows access through crevices previously unable to traverse
During backtracking for items, find optional elevator to magmoor caverns north blocked by intense heat
Heavy use of visible, but unusable spider-ball tracks in early Chozo Ruins
Scan hidden runics to unlock large door (search and activate to proceed)
Morph ball bombs allow certain materials to be broken, certain switches to be activated, and further morph ball mobility options
Timed morph ball bomb slot sequences to access optional energy tank (timed concecutive action sequence)
Master morph ball bomb timing to aquire optional missile expansion (rewarded by optional technique mastery)
MV Alternation model featuring double loops (early Chozo Ruins)
Two different roads within Magmoor caverns to choose from after Flahgraa (inverse forking)
Environmental changes (instead of powerups) give access to new micro-areas within Chozo Ruins post-Flahgraa (toxic water > clean water)
Alternation between macro-areas after Flahgraa (Phendrana > Talon IV > Phendrana)
Shooting stalactites to access higher spot (shoot to climb and proceed)
Higher level enemies fill in areas (backtrack filler)
Phendrana space pirate base section was cool (Linear fetch and escape)
Lore collection from computers in space pirate base
Return to Chozo ruins to explore with spider-ball post-Thardus (Victory lap with new toys)
Environmental manipulation gives access to new micro-areas via having certain beam weapons (hall of the elders)
Phendrada depths gravity suit section (Non-linear fetch and escape)
Find and activate power conduits (pirate base, crashed frigate)
Column twist puzzle in Phazon Mines
2/3rds non-linear item quest to proceed into Phazon Mines depths (X-ray visor/Grapple beam free post-power bomb, Plasma beam post-grapple beam)
X-ray visor allows you to see completely invisible objects (such as platforms and walls), and are sometimes hinted toward by rain droplets
New abilities can activate or unlock shortcuts for quicker, more streamlined traversal between areas
Grand fetch quest assisted by hints on where to find them (Chozo artifacts)
Level design, enemy design, and hidden powerups all take future upgrades into account for late game exploration
