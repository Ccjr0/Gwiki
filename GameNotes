# --- THOUGHTS
I think that given the task Retro Studios was given with, they hit the nail on the head making Metroid's debut in 3D, and filling in Super Metroid's shoes. Although not perfect, Prime serves as a great first-person action/adventure game - and perhaps the only of its kind - with such a heavy focus on the MV formula. The atmosphere just great. I think there was lots of thought put into the level design from the micro to the macro level. The levels and areas flow together nicely all things considered, and the emphasis on exploration and encouraging the player to check back on the things they were blue-balled on before was pretty good. Although it does a good job at honoring Super Metroid's design philosophy and atmosphere, the game feel leaves some to be desired- as it is after all a single-stick shooter. The targeting system does its best to keep things smooth, but looking around can feel stiff and slow at times. Platforming while not bad, isn't nearly as smooth and satisfying as in Super Metroid.
Here's some nitpicks and other thoughts. Although the flow between levels is generally good, I would've maybe liked it if there were more breakable or uncoverable shortcuts to make traveling even more streamlined accross areas. In this way I feel like the grapple beam is underutilized, as it is a prime candidate for this job, but it is also just fun to use. I think it would've been viable to use something other than strictly the "grapple points" as use for the grapple beam, such as maybe some more natural or mechanical elements that fit the environment you're in. Another thing I notice is that most of the extra/optional powerups aren't particularly exciting - as in they mainly consist of 5-stock missile expansions to add to your massive stockpile of missiles (which is nice, but at some point you question whether it becomes like a diminishing returns effect) and power bomb expansions which really dont serve much of a purpose besides breaking certain walls and saying "fuck it" to enemies that you just want to deal with quickly and get over with, and considering how easy it is for power bomb refills to drop from enemies anyway, these expansions really don't feel like they serve much of a meaningful purpose at all. There's also the elemental super missiles for each respective beam weapon, but the vanilla super missle is simply the most efficient in terms of both effectiveness and ammo efficiency, so the other ones are really kinda just "meh". There was only one blemish with the level design in this game which I particulary disliked, and it was retrieving the artifact of newborn. I feel like the fix would be very simply to put it closer to the exit point of the sub-area that it's in (being the Mines depths) but being right in the awkward middle area that it's in, and given that there isn't a backtrack-phase in that area like the other artifacts because it's the very end of the game, theres no way to go back and get it that doesn't feel like a real slog.

- Raven tank fight has the player fight a mobile tank with a main and secondary gun in a snowfield. You first need to get close enough to the tank to invalidate its main gun by taking advantage of the terrain and crawling along and behind hills to avoid being shot. Once within range, a soldier will try to track you with the secondary gatling gun while the tank body itself is highly maneuverable and dangerous- although it can be compromised with chaff grenades and explosives. The only way to defeat the boss is to lob a grenade into the manhole with replenishing (although limited) grenade and ration supplies scattered accross the snowfield.
- Gray fox fight requires the player to fight dodge, and chase the boss in a CQC duel. Gray fox will dodge any bullets, but chaff grenades can stun him.

Your rations will freeze if not kept warm by keeping them equipped
- Metal gear fight involves the player avoiding the boss's the primary attacks while shooting first its radome {weak point}, then cockpit. Metal gear has 3 ranged attacks: homing rockets, gatling gun, and laser- each with their own respective method and range of avoiding them. Starting midrange and moving toward MG while anticipating the 3 homing missiles firing (or watching the camera) lets you avoid them, but can set you up for a following laser attack for big damage if you dont move away quickly.

- Apparently cameras can be destroyed with the Stinger launcher {out-of-box option}

# --- AREAS
- Dock
    * Dock starts the game with the player being fully shrouded in cover by barrels and a pipe unit. To proceed, the player must crawl under the unit. {mechanical tutorial} Optionally, a ration is visible underwater as soon as the game starts {visual hinting}, and can be grabbed by going down the stairs and underwater to grab it. Once the player crawls past the pipe unit, a wall is revealed with a guard patrolling nearby in the main part of the room, where there are 4 large stacks of shipping crates in a square-grid pattern. {intersection} Here, the player is encouraged to hug the wall and wait for the guard to resume patrol. A puddle behind is waiting to the right after going past the guard to trigger the guard's sense of sound. The player is forced to either move up, right, or if the player gets caught, optionally jump off down into the water to escape. {out-of-box option} There is an identical pipe unit on the reciprocating side of the level with another optional ration behind it. {reciprocation} A forklift in the far northeast corner is good for hiding behind to wait for the elevator to come down and sneak inside.

- Heliport
    * Heliport has two points of infultration- one ventilation opening in lower and one higher up the stairs, both on the far north end of the level. It also has moving spotlights in the center that have a repeating pattern with different points of entry to bypass them and a set of chaff grenades if you can grab them as a reward for challenging the lights. There is an optional surveillance camera room on the west end of the level which features a swivelling camera with a shipping crate and cranny as a blind spot, and the room holds stun grenades as a reward. Further up the level on the northwest side there is a ventilation opening with sleeping guard with a sleeping guard in front of it as well as a camera. In the far north there is a truck that can be used as cover, and can even be climbed into to optionally recieve a SOCOM pistol with limited ammo. In the east there is a snowy area with 3 boxes in a striaght vertical line that can be used as cover from a patrolling guard. {consecutive cover} The guard can see the player's footprints in the snow and follow them indefinitely. Behind the final box there is a ration and a staircase upstairs guarded by a swivelling camera. There is also a ditch to the left of this snowy area to crawl past the guard completely into the area with the truck.

- Hangar
    * Hangar can be entered from two ways depending on how you finish the Heliport. If you enter from the top side, you will be brought to the ceiling ventilation shaft where you will end up being brought down a ladder and start on the second floor where you can find chaff grenades and the optional thermal goggles within a cargo room with a security camera. If you enter from the bottom side, you will follow the rats to the bottom of the hangar and exit on the east side of the bottom floor of the hanger. The hangar features two large tanks that can be hid behind  extra ammo for socom is hidden under the main staircase, as well as optional thermal goggles on second floor. Optionally the player can backtrack once getting level 1 card to retrieve the cardboard box A and socom supressor from previously locked doors in the up and downstairs respectively

    * Cell 

- Armory
    * Armory features a grid-like layout of individual rooms each with locked or unlocked doors of varying card levels, as well as destructable walls both containing optional items on either end of the north side of the level and story progression on the south. It also features new traps such as infrared lasers and floor traps that can both bee seen with the thermal goggles, and most rooms have areas to hid in 

- Nuclear warhead storage building
    * Nuke storage building features crates of dismantled warheads all around, so using standard weaponry is disabled

- Nuke building B1
    * Nuke building B1 features a bathroom where guards occasionally break their routine to go and pee. They can be followed in and are vulnerable while doing so. There is also a Nikita launcher behind a door in the main computer room, as well as ammo hidden under the desks

- Nuke building B2
    * Nuke building B2 features a high-voltage generator that electricutes the floor along the long corridors past the main door. The generator is visible through the glass as soon as you enter, but the only way to destroy it is with a remote-controlled missile from the nikita launcher. The corridors are equipped with armed security cameras that can potentially shoot down the rocket unless you accelerate. Once you destroy the generator, the player can proceed but the corridors are still filled with a poisonous gas that slowly drains your O2 meter. An optional gas mask is behind one of the many doors in the poisonous corridors, as well as plenty of ammo refills, NVG and the way to progression.

- Blast furnace
    * Blast Furnace

# --- THOUGHTS
MGS1 is an interesting one coming back to. Coming back to at after so long and after playing Metroid Prime and MGSV made me dislike the game at first. This was mainly because I was directly comparing the gameplay from both of those games to this one which in hindsight was not the best idea. After thoroughly playing through the game, I've come to appreciate what it is on its own after forcing myself to adapt and overcome to its differences from MGSV. It is a classic for sure but it is certainly not without its flaws- most of them IMO having to do with too with uninspired/questionable level design late game. Not to mention the backtracking, while I personally don't mind it certainly is nowhere near as "gracefully" executed or perhaps "flow-ey" as the Metroid games. Since the game has a very limited camera situation, the radar system is a very useful tool to help give some spacial awareness to the player instead of the player having to use the stationary first-person view constantly or rely on memory or "gamesense", and since the guards' vision-cone is limited and clealy defined, I believe the radar system is helpful (though not essential) for a fully cohesive gameplay experience in this game, at least on the first playthrough.

- Pressing the action button while hugging against a low enough surface can enable you to climb on top of the object
- Picking up and dropping incapacitated guards can sometimes drop ammo
- 3-hit combo no longer has extended hitbox
- Walking in rain or in puddles followed by walking on a dry surface will result in wet footsteps being left behind, and guards can notice and follow them
- Lockers can be opened and used to be hid in, or to hide another incapacitated guard. Locked doors can also be punched/shot down to reveal contents
- Guards include visual fuzzy detection that extends slightly outside their main vision cone. When triggered, they will pathfind through the shortest path to investigate the area you were suspected of being when it triggered. They will then return to their normal post if undisturbed
- Guards have invisible vision cones that can detect you when you are on a different level above or below them. When you activate this, it will trigger fuzzy detection
- Upon being spotted, the enemy will attempt to radio-in for backup by hiding, or by melee attacking if youre too close. If his queue finishes, the guards will enter 'alert' phase where radar is jammed and guards are aware of your presence. Attack team will be called in as well, and guards will recieve backup if they are killed in this phase, and will previously dead guards will be replaced. Once evaded, the guards will enter 'clearing' mode where guards will clear your area of most hiding spots. Once cleared, the guards will enter 'caution' mode where attack team leaves, and guards are on high alert
- Attack team guards can have riot shields and shotguns
- The effects of a tranquilizer round are highly dependent on where on the body it is shot- the head having the fastest effect
- If a guard is tranquilized next to a nearby guard, that guard will notice and call in for the attack team, triggering 'caution' mode. If an already tranquilized guard is noticed by another guard, that guard will walk over to him and simply wake him up. If a tranquilized guard wakes up on his own, he will simply go back on patrol. If a dead guard is found by another guard, that guard will call in for the attack team as well as a replacement for the dead guard, triggering 'caution' mode
- Depending on area and lighting, player and enemy models give off shadows, and can even be seen by enemies
- Environmental elements include fire hydrants, steam ducts, light bulbs, wine glasses, electric bells, icecubes, bags of flour, glass panes, pots and pans
- Playing through "Tanker" on hard locks certain doors to access the ship, forcing the player to go through a different (longer) path to reach the destination. In addition to generally more soldiers in certain areas throughout the game, hard mode can add more mission objectives such as a higher number of bombs to freeze in the "Plant" level
- Olga fight involves a handgun dual between several bits of cover for both the boss and the player as well as environmental elements the boss uses against the player, such as a bright spotlight and tarp being held down by bricks. The boss can also throw grenades behind cover she things the player is hiding behind
- Soldier fight is very similar in substance to the Olga fight but with less environmental variables, multiple enemies, and in a very tight, narrow corridor
- AP Sensor detects nearby lifeforms and vibrates on enemy approach
- Interactable computer modules called "nodes" are on every room of the big shell, and show up as a stationary blue dot on the radar. Once activated, you will recieve a topographic map of the room the node is in on your radar. Nodes can also be used to change in-game options
- Hidden C4 Explosives must be frozen with coolant. The location of bombs can be determined by its odor cloud showing up on radar when holding the bomb sensor. Coolant can also be used for chasing away bugs, waking up sleeping soldiers, and removing fire to gain access to micro-areas
- Fatman fight involves an arena similar to the one in vulkan raven, although more open. Fatman is very mobile due to his roller blades, and will place C4 around the map that must all be frozen within the time limit. Fatman can hide bombs in different areas such as on shelves, barrels, and even on top of or below containers. Due to his bomb suit being highly shielded, damage when shooting him is highly minimal, but rapid fire will knock him off balance and reveal his head
- In order to access the Shell 1 core basement, the player must return to the warehouse with the Lvl 2 card and find the room with an AKS-74u (and optionally the M4) in order to blend in with the soldiers there so that the elevator camera won't be alerted

    * Engine room port-side has 3 IR sensors and their respective controllers hooked up to semtex explosives. The only way to get past is by deactivating the semtex controllers by shooting them. One is in plain sight, another is visible by standing on top of an object. The last one is visible once the first two are taken out so that you can get close enough to shoot it

- Hold no.1 / 2 etc.
    * Holds feature many soldiers facing a projection of the commandant giving a speech. Progresssion rooms are located at the front of each hold. The player must sneak around the soldiers' field of vision by staying around the edges of the holds and yielding to variables along the way such as avoiding light rays from the projector, soldiers on the ends that move, soldiers

    * Each strut is connected by another strut by means of a connecting bridge. Some bridges have a higher and lower entrance to each strut, giving the player the option to choose which level of the next room they wish to infultrate. Connecting bridges are typically guarded by guards and flying camera drones. The drones can move side to side and raise and lower the level they are on- they can also not hear gunshots. The bridges have fully shrouded railings for the player to crawl along, and open guard railings that are see-through, but can be hanged along to get past guards, or get past other obstacles.

- Warehouse

- Parcel Room
    * Parcel room features a large room with an active conveyer belt moving boxes in a loop along the whole room. Cameras are mounted on columns in the middle of the room, and can be snuck past by crawling under the belt machine without being caught by the guards, or by walking along the conveyer belt at the same speed as the boxes that it carries by. {moving cover} There are also shelves in the far north end of the room to hide under.
