# --- Thoughts
I think that given the task Retro Studios was given with, they hit the nail on the head making Metroid's debut in 3D, and filling in Super Metroid's shoes. Although not perfect, Prime serves as a great first-person action/adventure game - and perhaps the only of its kind - with such a heavy focus on the MV formula. The atmosphere just great. I think there was lots of thought put into the level design from the micro to the macro level. The levels and areas flow together nicely all things considered, and the emphasis on exploration and encouraging the player to check back on the things they were blue-balled on before was pretty good. Although it does a good job at honoring Super Metroid's design philosophy and atmosphere, the game feel leaves some to be desired- as it is after all a single-stick shooter. The targeting system does its best to keep things smooth, but looking around can feel stiff and slow at times. Platforming while not bad, isn't nearly as smooth and satisfying as in Super Metroid.
Here's some nitpicks and other thoughts. Although the flow between levels is generally good, I would've maybe liked it if there were more breakable or uncoverable shortcuts to make traveling even more streamlined accross areas. In this way I feel like the grapple beam is underutilized, as it is a prime candidate for this job, but it is also just fun to use. I think it would've been viable to use something other than strictly the "grapple points" as use for the grapple beam, such as maybe some more natural or mechanical elements that fit the environment you're in. Another thing I notice is that most of the extra/optional powerups aren't particularly exciting - as in they mainly consist of 5-stock missile expansions to add to your massive stockpile of missiles (which is nice, but at some point you question whether it becomes like a diminishing returns effect) and power bomb expansions which really dont serve much of a purpose besides breaking certain walls and saying "fuck it" to enemies that you just want to deal with quickly and get over with, and considering how easy it is for power bomb refills to drop from enemies anyway, these expansions really don't feel like they serve much of a meaningful purpose at all. There's also the elemental super missiles for each respective beam weapon, but the vanilla super missle is simply the most efficient in terms of both effectiveness and ammo efficiency, so the other ones are really kinda just "meh". There was only one blemish with the level design in this game which I particulary disliked, and it was retrieving the artifact of newborn. I feel like the fix would be very simply to put it closer to the exit point of the sub-area that it's in (being the Mines depths) but being right in the awkward middle area that it's in, and given that there isn't a backtrack-phase in that area like the other artifacts because it's the very end of the game, theres no way to go back and get it that doesn't feel like a real slog.

Completing boss fights permanently raises health bar
To progress further at this point, the player must look on the back of the game CD case to speak with Meryl to proceed
Tank hanger exit requires the player to dodge a series of vertical moving infrared lasers to avoid being locked in with gas. The lasers can be easily seen with thermal goggles or by smoking
Claymore mines can be crawled upon to be picked up, or can be detected with an optional mine detector that can be found in the tank hanger once you have a level 2 card
Raven tank fight has the player fight a mobile tank with a main and secondary gun in a snowfield. You first need to get close enough to the tank to invalidate its main gun by taking advantage of the terrain and crawling along and behind hills to avoid being shot. Once within range, a soldier will try to track you with the secondary gatling gun while the tank body itself is highly maneuverable and dangerous- although it can be compromised with chaff grenades and explosives. The only way to defeat the boss is to lob a grenade into the manhole with replenishing (although limited) grenade and ration supplies scattered accross the snowfield.
Gray fox fight requires the player to fight dodge, and chase the boss in a CQC duel. Gray fox will dodge any bullets, but chaff grenades can stun him.

Vulcan raven fight involves a game of cat and mouse between a large grid of containers, where the player needs to take down raven while avoiding being shot down in his massive line of sight. Raven gets faster and can damage certain containers blocking access between them as the fight progresses. Explosive rockets are viable, but placed explosives are most efficient. Your rations will freeze if not kept warm by keeping them equipped
Metal gear fight involves the player avoiding the boss's the primary attacks while shooting first its radome, then cockpit. Metal gear has 3 ranged attacks: homing rockets, gatling gun, and laser- each with their own respective method and range of avoiding them. Starting midrange and moving toward MG while the 3 homing missiles fire lets you avoid them, but can set you up for a following laser attack for big damage if you dont move away quickly. The tracking gatling gun can be avoided by maintaining side movement.

Pressing the action button while hugging against a low enough surface can enable you to climb on top of the object
Picking up and dropping incapacitated guards can sometimes drop ammo
3-hit combo no longer has extended hitbox
Walking in rain or in puddles followed by walking on a dry surface will result in wet footsteps being left behind, and guards can notice and follow them
Lockers can be opened and used to be hid in, or to hide another incapacitated guard. Locked doors can also be punched/shot down to reveal contents
Guards include visual fuzzy detection that extends slightly outside their main vision cone. When triggered, they will pathfind through the shortest path to investigate the area you were suspected of being when it triggered. They will then return to their normal post if undisturbed
Guards have invisible vision cones that can detect you when you are on a different level above or below them. When you activate this, it will trigger fuzzy detection
Upon being spotted, the enemy will attempt to radio-in for backup by hiding, or by melee attacking if you're too close. If his queue finishes, the guards will enter 'alert' phase where radar is jammed and guards are aware of your presence. Attack team will be called in as well, and guards will recieve backup if they are killed in this phase, and will previously dead guards will be replaced. Once evaded, the guards will enter 'clearing' mode where guards will clear your area of most hiding spots. Once cleared, the guards will enter 'caution' mode where attack team leaves, and guards are on high alert
Attack team guards can have riot shields and shotguns
The effects of a tranquilizer round are highly dependent on where on the body it is shot- the head having the fastest effect
If a guard is tranquilized next to a nearby guard, that guard will notice and call in for the attack team, triggering 'caution' mode. If an already tranquilized guard is noticed by another guard, that guard will walk over to him and simply wake him up. If a tranquilized guard wakes up on his own, he will simply go back on patrol. If a dead guard is found by another guard, that guard will call in for the attack team as well as a replacement for the dead guard, triggering 'caution' mode
Depending on area and lighting, player and enemy models give off shadows, and can even be seen by enemies
Environmental elements include fire hydrants, steam ducts, light bulbs, wine glasses, electric bells, icecubes, bags of flour, glass panes, pots and pans
Playing through "Tanker" on hard locks certain doors to access the ship, forcing the player to go through a different (longer) path to reach the destination. In addition to generally more soldiers in certain areas throughout the game, hard mode can add more mission objectives such as a higher number of bombs to freeze in the "Plant" level
Olga fight involves a handgun dual between several bits of cover for both the boss and the player as well as environmental elements the boss uses against the player, such as a bright spotlight and tarp being held down by bricks. The boss can also throw grenades behind cover she things the player is hiding behind
Soldier fight is very similar in substance to the Olga fight but with less environmental variables, multiple enemies, and in a very tight, narrow corridor
AP Sensor detects nearby lifeforms and vibrates on enemy approach
Interactable computer modules called "nodes" are on every room of the big shell, and show up as a stationary blue dot on the radar. Once activated, you will recieve a topographic map of the room the node is in on your radar. Nodes can also be used to change in-game options
Hidden C4 Explosives must be frozen with coolant. The location of bombs can be determined by its odor cloud showing up on radar when holding the bomb sensor. Coolant can also be used for chasing away bugs, waking up sleeping soldiers, and removing fire to gain access to micro-areas
Fatman fight involves an arena similar to the one in vulkan raven, although more open. Fatman is very mobile due to his roller blades, and will place C4 around the map that must all be frozen within the time limit. Fatman can hide bombs in different areas such as on shelves, barrels, and even on top of or below containers. Due to his bomb suit being highly shielded, damage when shooting him is highly minimal, but rapid fire will knock him off balance and reveal his head
In order to access the Shell 1 core basement, the player must return to the warehouse with the Lvl 2 card and find the room with an AKS-74u (and optionally the M4) in order to blend in with the soldiers there so that the elevator camera won't be alerted

- Crew's quarters
- Crew's lounge
- Navigation deck
- Engine room
    * Engine room port-side has 3 IR sensors and their respective controllers hooked up to semtex explosives. The only way to get past is by deactivating the semtex controllers by shooting them. One is in plain sight, another is visible by standing on top of an object. The last one is visible once the first two are taken out so that you can get close enough to shoot it
- Hold no.1 / 2 etc.
    * Holds feature many soldiers facing a projection of the commandant giving a speech. Progresssion rooms are located at the front of each hold. The player must sneak around the soldiers' field of vision by staying around the edges of the holds and yielding to variables along the way such as avoiding light rays from the projector, soldiers on the ends that move, soldiers

    * Each strut is connected by another strut by means of a connecting bridge. Some bridges have a higher and lower entrance to each strut, giving the player the option to choose which level of the next room they wish to infultrate. Connecting bridges are typically guarded by guards and flying camera drones. The drones can move side to side and raise and lower the level they are on- they can also not hear gunshots. The bridges have fully shrouded railings for the player to crawl along, and open guard railings that are see-through, but can be hanged along to get past guards, or get past other obstacles.

- Warehouse
- Parcel Room
    * Parcel room features a large room with an active conveyer belt moving boxes in a loop along the whole room. Cameras are mounted on columns in the middle of the room, and can be snuck past by crawling under the belt machine without being caught by the guards, or by walking along the conveyer belt at the same speed as the boxes that it carries by. There are also shelves in the far north end of the room to hide under.
